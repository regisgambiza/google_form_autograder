## Question 1: 1. The temperature in Chiang Mai was 6°C at noon. By midnight, it had fallen by 11 degrees. What is the midnight temperature?
**Correct Answer:** -5
**Explanation / Steps:**
## Feedback  
Good job! You answered many of the questions correctly.  
The correct midnight temperature is **–5°C**.  

## Steps to Solve  
1. Start with the noon temperature: 6°C.  
2. The temperature fell by 11°C.  
3. Subtract 11 from 6:  
   6–11 = –5.  
4. Write the answer with the degree sign: –5°C.  

## Common Mistakes  
- **Missing the minus sign**: writing 5°C instead of –5°C.  
- **Adding instead of subtracting**: 6+11 would give 17, which is wrong.  
- **Wrong unit**: writing 5c or –5cm instead of °C.  
- **Wrong operation order**: doing 11–6 gives 5, not –5.

## Question 2: 2. A diver in Phuket starts at sea level (0 m) and descends 18 meters. Then he rises 7 meters. What is his final depth?
**Correct Answer:** 11
**Explanation / Steps:**
## Feedback  
Good job trying!  
The right answer is **11m**.

## Steps to Solve  
1. Start at the sea level: depth = 0m.  
2. Descend 18m → depth = 0m + 18m = **18m**.  
3. Rise 7m (go up) → depth = 18m – 7m = **11m**.  
So the final depth is **11m** below the surface.

## Common Mistakes  
- Writing **‑11m**: that would mean 11m *above* the surface, which is wrong.  
- Forgetting the sign of “rise”. “Rise” means go *up*, so subtract the 7m.  
- Mixing up meters and feet or putting the sign in the wrong place.

## Keep Practicing

## Question 3: 3. A shopkeeper in Bangkok lost 450 baht one day (recorded as −450). The next day, he earned 1200 baht. What is his total over 2 days?
**Correct Answer:** 750
**Explanation / Steps:**
## Feedback  
Good job!  
Most of you wrote the right answer **750 baht**.  
A few of you wrote extra letters or numbers, and a few had small mistakes.  

## Steps to Solve  
1. Write the loss: `-450`.  
2. Write the gain: `+1200`.  
3. Add them: `-450 + 1200`.  
4. 1200 minus 450 equals **750**.  
5. The total is **750 baht** for the two days.  

## Common Mistakes  
- **Missing the sign**: Writing just `750` is fine, but writing `-450` alone or `+1200` alone is wrong.  
- **Extra letters**: `750m` or `750 b` – the `m` or `b` are unnecessary.  
- **Wrong numbers**: `135`, `300`, or `3^8` – those numbers do not come from the addition.  
- **Using a period**: `.` or `750.` – a period is not needed.  

## Keep Practicing  
You can do it! Keep adding numbers with signs. The more you practice, the easier it becomes. Happy learning!

## Question 4: 4. A fisherman’s boat is 5 m below sea level. A seagull is flying 12 m above sea level. What is the difference in their heights?
**Correct Answer:** 17
**Explanation / Steps:**
## Feedback  
Good job!  
You found the right answer many times.  

The difference in height is **17 m**.  
That is the distance between the boat (5m below sea level) and the seagull (12m above sea level).

---

## Steps to Solve  
1. **Write the heights.**  
   - Boat: –5 m (below sea level)  
   - Seagull: +12 m (above sea level)  

2. **Subtract the boat height from the seagull height.**  
   \[
   12 - (-5)
   \]

3. **Change the minus to a plus.**  
   \[
   12 + 5 = 17
   \]

4. **Add the unit.**  
   The answer is **17m**.

---

## Common Mistakes  
- **Missing the unit “m”** – write “17m” or “17meters”.  
- **Wrong sign** – some wrote “-5” or “7” instead of adding the 5.  
- **Not using the minus sign** – remember the boat is below sea level, so it is –5 m.  
- **Subtracting instead of adding** – do 12 + 5, not 12 – 5.  

Example:  
Wrong: \(12 - 5 = 7\)  
Correct: \(12 - (-5) = 12 + 5 = 17\)

## Question 5: 5. Multiply: A farmer’s debt increases by 6 baht each day for 4 days. Represent and calculate this as an integer multiplication.
**Correct Answer:** 24
**Explanation / Steps:**
## Feedback  
Good job!  
The correct answer is **24 baht**.  

## Steps to Solve  
1. The debt rises **6 baht** each day.  
2. It happens for **4 days**.  
3. Multiply: 6 × 4 = 24.  
4. The result is **24 baht**.  

## Common Mistakes  
- **Writing a minus sign** (‑24) – the debt only goes up, not down.  
- **Adding extra words** like “bath” or “baht” inside the calculation.  
- **Wrong numbers** (5, 750, 8100) – check the two numbers you multiply.

## Question 6: 6. A tuk-tuk driver made 8 trips and lost 25 baht per trip on fuel costs. Express this as multiplication and find the total loss.
**Correct Answer:** 200
**Explanation / Steps:**
## Feedback  
Good job!  
You are almost ready to get the correct answer. The loss is **‑200 baht**.

## Steps to Solve  
1. Think of a loss of 25 baht for one trip.  
2. Multiply the loss by the number of trips.  
   * 25 × 8 = 200  
3. Since it is a loss, put a minus sign in front.  
   * 200 with a minus sign → **‑200 baht**

## Common Mistakes  
- **Missing the minus sign**: writing “200” instead of “‑200”.  
  *Example*: “200 baht” is a gain, not a loss.  
- **Using the wrong order**: writing “8 × 25” is fine, but forget the minus.  
- **Writing extra words**: “200 bahts” is okay, but “200 bath” is a typo.  
- **Wrong numbers**: answers like “33” or “48” come from mis‑counting trips or loss amount.

## Keep Practicing  
You can do it! Keep writing the minus sign for losses. Try another problem:  
“If a bus loses 10 baht each ride and rides 5 times, what is the total loss?”

## Question 7: 7. The average July temperature in Chiang Rai is 27°C. In winter, it can drop to −2°C. What is the temperature difference?
**Correct Answer:** 29
**Explanation / Steps:**
## Feedback  
Good job!  
The correct temperature difference is **29°C**.

## Steps to Solve  
1. Take the July average: 27°C.  
2. Take the winter minimum: –2°C.  
3. Subtract winter from July:  
   27°C – (–2°C).  
4. Removing the minus gives 27°C + 2°C = 29°C.

## Common Mistakes  
- **Skipping the minus sign**: 27°C – –2°C should become 27°C + 2°C, not 27°C – 2°C.  
- **Wrong answer like 32 or 25**: Those numbers come from adding 27 + 5 or adding 27 + 25, not the correct operation.  
- **Missing units**: It is good practice to write “29°C” or “29c” to show the unit.

## Keep Practicing  
Try another pair of temperatures. Keep checking your signs, and you will do great!

## Question 8: 8. A football team in Bangkok won 3 games (+3 points each), lost 2 games (−1 point each), and drew 1 game (0 points). What is their total score?
**Correct Answer:** 7
**Explanation / Steps:**
## Feedback  
Good job, everyone!  
The team’s total score is **7 points**.

---

## Steps to Solve  
1. **Wins**: 3 games × 3 points each = 9 points.  
2. **Losses**: 2 games × (‑1 point each) = ‑2 points.  
3. **Draw**: 1 game × 0 points = 0 points.  
4. Add them together: 9  + (‑2)  + 0  = 7 points.

---

## Common Mistakes  
- **Mixing up signs**: Some answers had “‑2 point” or “‑4” which came from forgetting that a loss gives ‑1 point each.  
- **Skipping a step**: Writing “9 – 2” without explaining the 0 from the draw can be confusing.  
- **Wrong multiplication**: Forgetting to multiply 3 wins by 3 points or 2 losses by ‑1 point.

---

## Keep Practicing  
You are all on the right track. Keep checking each part (wins, losses, draws) before adding them. You can do it!

## Question 9: 9. A fruit seller sold 9 durians at a loss of 15 baht each. Express this as multiplication and find the total loss.
**Correct Answer:** 135
**Explanation / Steps:**
## Feedback  
Good job on giving the answer many times!  
The correct total loss is **-135 baht**.  
You were close, but remember that a *loss* is written as a negative number.

## Steps to Solve  
1. Each durian lost 15 baht.  
2. The seller sold 9 durians.  
3. Multiply: 9 × (-15).  
4. 9 × 15 = 135.  
5. Add the negative sign: -135.  
So the total loss is **-135 baht**.

## Common Mistakes  
- **Forgetting the minus sign**: writing 135 instead of -135.  
- **Mixing up loss and gain**: a loss is negative, a gain is positive.  
- **Using the wrong multiplication order**: 15 × 9 is fine, but remember the negative sign comes first.

## Keep Practicing  
Keep checking whether you need a plus or minus sign. You can do it!

## Question 10: 10. The water level in the Chao Phraya River dropped 3 cm each day for 7 days. How much did it drop in total?
**Correct Answer:** 21
**Explanation / Steps:**
## Feedback  
Good job! You answered the question correctly in most cases.  
The total drop is **21 cm**.

## Steps to Solve  
1. The river drops **3 cm each day**.  
2. There are **7 days**.  
3. Multiply the daily drop by the number of days:  
   `3 cm × 7 = 21 cm`.  

So the water level dropped **21 centimeters** in total.

## Common Mistakes  
* **Writing “21 days”** – The answer should be a number with the unit **cm**, not days.  
* **Adding 3 cm 7 times** – That is the same as multiplying, but writing “3 + 3 + …” is long and can cause errors.  
* **Missing the unit** – Always put “cm” after the number.  
* **Changing the sign** – The drop is a decrease, but we usually give the magnitude, so 21 cm, not –21 cm.  
* **Wrong multiplication** – Some wrote 27 or 125. Check that you use 3 × 7, not 7 × 3 + 3 or other mixes.

## Keep Practicing  
Keep using multiplication for repeated additions. You can do it!

## Question 12: 12. A cube-shaped container in Chiang Mai has side length 5 m. Find its volume.
**Correct Answer:** 125
**Explanation / Steps:**
## Feedback  
Good job!  
The right answer is **125 m³**.  
Many of you wrote 125 or 125 m³, which is correct. Some added extra words or wrong units. Keep an eye on the units.

## Steps to Solve  
1. Find the side length of the cube.  
   * It is 5 m.  
2. Volume of a cube = side × side × side.  
   * 5 × 5 × 5 = 125.  
3. Write the unit.  
   * Each side is in meters, so the volume is in cubic meters (m³).  
   * Result: **125 m³**.

## Common Mistakes  
* **Missing the unit** – 125 without “m³” is okay, but better to show the unit.  
* **Using the wrong unit** – “125 square m” (m²) is area, not volume.  
* **Not cubing the side** – 5 × 5 = 25 (area of a face).  
* **Wrong numbers** – “29 °C” or “1”, “135” are not related to the question.  

## Keep Practicing  
You are on the right track!  
Just remember: cube volume = side³, and use the unit m³. Keep practicing, and you will get even better!

## Question 13: 13. A farmer planted 100 mango trees. Each tree produces about 9^2 mangoes. Estimate the total.
**Correct Answer:** 8100
**Explanation / Steps:**
## Feedback  
Good job!  
You gave the right answer many times.  
The total number of mangoes is **8100**.

## Steps to Solve  
1. Find how many mangoes one tree gives.  
   - The problem says each tree gives about \(9^2\) mangoes.  
   - \(9^2 = 9 × 9 = 81\).  
2. Multiply the number of trees by the mangoes per tree.  
   - 100 trees × 81 mangoes/tree = 8100 mangoes.  

## Common Mistakes  
- **Missing the square**: Some wrote “100 × 9 = 900” instead of squaring 9.  
- **Dropping the 100**: Writing “81” only, forgetting the 100 trees.  
- **Wrong power**: Writing “9^200” or “9^20” instead of “9^2”.  
- **Wrong order**: Writing “17 m” or “1800” – those numbers are not related.  

Example of a mistake:  
`100 × 9 = 900` (wrong, because 9 was not squared).

## Question 14: 14. A battery stores 2^6 units of energy. If 2^4 units are used, how many remain?
**Correct Answer:** 48
**Explanation / Steps:**
## Feedback  
Good job to everyone who got the right answer!  
The battery had **2⁶ = 64** units.  
When you use **2⁴ = 16** units, you have **64 – 16 = 48** units left.  

## Steps to Solve  
1. Write the energy stored: 2⁶.  
2. Calculate 2⁶: 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 = 64.  
3. Write the energy used: 2⁴.  
4. Calculate 2⁴: 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 = 16.  
5. Subtract the used energy from the stored energy: 64 – 16 = 48.  
6. The answer is 48 units.  

## Common Mistakes  
- **Only writing 16**: Forgetting to subtract from the total.  
- **Writing 96 or 416**: Mixing up addition with subtraction or adding extra numbers.  
- **Writing 2²**: Confusing the powers – 2⁶ is 64, not 2² (which is 4).  
- **Answering “Hs” or “2⁶ = 64, 2⁴ = 16, 64 – 16 = 48”**: Good, but remember to put the final number (48) clearly.  

## Keep Practicing  
You can do it! Keep checking your work by writing the steps clearly. Practice more power‑of‑two problems and you’ll get even faster. Happy learning!

## Question 15: 15. A parcel company charges 3^3 baht per box. How much do 5 boxes cost?
**Correct Answer:** 135
**Explanation / Steps:**
## Feedback  

Good job to everyone who answered **135**!  
You did the calculation correctly.  

For the students who gave other numbers, you missed one small step. Let’s see how to solve it right.

## Steps to Solve  

1. **Find the cost of one box.**  
   The company charges \(3^3\) baht per box.  
   \(3^3 = 3 \times 3 \times 3 = 27\) baht.

2. **Multiply by the number of boxes.**  
   There are 5 boxes.  
   \(27 \times 5 = 135\) baht.

3. **Answer:** 5 boxes cost **135 baht**.

## Common Mistakes  

- **Using the wrong exponent:**  
  Some wrote \(3^{15}\) or \(3^3 \times 5\) incorrectly.  
  Remember \(3^3\) is just 27, not 3 raised to the 15th power.

- **Wrong multiplication:**  
  Writing \(9\) or \(7\) comes from mis‑multiplying \(27 \times 5\).  
  Check the multiplication table or do it step‑by‑step.

- **Missing the “baht” unit:**  
  The answer should include “baht” to show the money amount.

## Question 16: 16. Simplify: (2^3 × 2^2) ÷ 2^4, and explain how index laws help.
**Correct Answer:** 2
**Explanation / Steps:**
## Feedback  
Good job!  
The correct answer is **2**.  

## Steps to Solve  
1. Write the expression with powers.  
   \[(2^3 \times 2^2) ÷ 2^4\]  
2. When you multiply the same base, add the exponents.  
   \[2^3 \times 2^2 = 2^{3+2} = 2^5\]  
3. Now divide by the same base, subtract the exponent.  
   \[2^5 ÷ 2^4 = 2^{5-4} = 2^1\]  
4. Anything to the power of 1 is the number itself.  
   \[2^1 = 2\]

## Common Mistakes  
- **Adding instead of subtracting**:  
  \[(2^3 × 2^2) ÷ 2^4\] → wrong: \(2^{3+2+4}=2^9\).  
  Remember: multiply → add, divide → subtract.  

- **Mixing up “+” and “×”**:  
  \(2^3+2^2\) is **different** from \(2^3×2^2\).  
  Always read the symbol first.  

- **Forgetting the base is the same**:  
  If the base changes (e.g., \(3^2 ÷ 2^2\)), you cannot use this rule.  

## Keep Practicing  
Try another problem:  
\[(3^4 ÷ 3^2) × 3^1\]  
Use the same add‑or‑subtract rule. You can do it!

## Question 17: 17. Simplify: (3^2)^4 using index laws.
**Correct Answer:** 3^8
**Explanation / Steps:**
## Feedback  

Good job to everyone who answered **6561**!  
You are using the correct rule for powers of powers.  
A few of you wrote **3⁸** or **6,561**—that’s also fine because 3⁸ equals 6561.  

## Steps to Solve  

1. Write the problem: \((3^2)^4\).  
2. Use the index law \((a^m)^n = a^{m \times n}\).  
3. Multiply the exponents: \(2 \times 4 = 8\).  
4. Replace the exponent: \((3^2)^4 = 3^8\).  
5. Find the value of \(3^8\):  
   \[
   3^1 = 3,\;
   3^2 = 9,\;
   3^3 = 27,\;
   3^4 = 81,\;
   3^5 = 243,\;
   3^6 = 729,\;
   3^7 = 2187,\;
   3^8 = 6561.
   \]

So the simplified form is **6561**.

## Common Mistakes  

| Mistake | Why it happens | Example |
|---------|----------------|---------|
| Writing **63** instead of 6561 | Confusing the exponent with a decimal point or a typo | 3⁸ ≠ 63 |
| Writing **-24** or **-135** | Mixing up the operation with subtraction or a different number | (3²)⁴ ≠ -24 |
| Using **3⁶** or **32** | Forgetting to multiply the exponents or mis‑reading the power | (3²)⁴ should be 3^(2×4)=3⁸, not 3⁶ |
| Writing **9×6561** | Misunderstanding that “×” is multiplication of numbers, not exponents | 3²×4 is wrong; it is 2×4 inside the exponent |
| Writing **3² x 4** | Thinking “×4” means multiply the base by 4 | It means multiply the exponent 2 by 4 |

**Tip:** Always write the rule first: \((a^m)^n = a^{m \times n}\). Then do the multiplication in the exponent before you calculate the power.

## Keep Practicing  

You’re doing great! Keep checking the rule for powers of powers, and soon you’ll get the answer in one step. You can do it!

## Question 18: 18. A school in Bangkok doubles its number of students every year. If it starts with 2^3 students, how many will it have after 2 years?
**Correct Answer:** 32
**Explanation / Steps:**
## Feedback  
Good job!  
You answered the question correctly. The answer is **32**.

## Steps to Solve  
1. The school starts with \(2^3\) students.  
2. \(2^3 = 8\).  
3. The school doubles every year.  
4. After 1 year: \(8 \times 2 = 16\).  
5. After 2 years: \(16 \times 2 = 32\).  
6. So, the school will have 32 students after 2 years.

## Common Mistakes  
- **Not doubling twice**: Some wrote \(2^3 = 8\) and then stopped, forgetting the two years of doubling.  
- **Wrong exponent**: Writing \(2^9\) or \(2^5\) mixes up the original number with the doubling process.  
- **Mixing up units**: Answers like “21cm” or “1” are not students.  
- **Missing multiplication**: Forgetting to multiply by 2 for each year gives numbers like 28 or 12.

## Keep Practicing  
Keep using the same steps: start number, double each year, multiply.  
You can do it! Keep up the good work.

## Question 19: 19. A factory produces 2^7 bottles per day. How many bottles in 3 days?
**Correct Answer:** 384
**Explanation / Steps:**
## Feedback  
Good job!  
You gave the right answer in most cases. The correct answer is **384 bottles**.

## Steps to Solve  
1. The factory makes \(2^7\) bottles each day.  
2. Calculate \(2^7\).  
   * \(2 \times 2 = 4\)  
   * \(4 \times 2 = 8\)  
   * \(8 \times 2 = 16\)  
   * \(16 \times 2 = 32\)  
   * \(32 \times 2 = 64\)  
   * \(64 \times 2 = 128\)  
   So, \(2^7 = 128\).  
3. The factory works 3 days.  
4. Multiply: \(128 \times 3 = 384\).  
5. The answer is **384 bottles**.

## Common Mistakes  
- **Not multiplying by 3**: Some answers showed only \(2^7 = 128\).  
- **Wrong power of 2**: Writing \(2^{21}\) or \(3^{10}\) is incorrect.  
- **Wrong units**: Saying “768” or “19293” is not the number of bottles in 3 days.  
- **Writing the answer without “bottles”**: It is good practice to add the unit.

You all understood that a real number cannot give a negative result when it is squared.  
Some of you wrote great examples, but a few wrote short dots or mixed up the wording.  
Let’s see how to write a clear answer.

## Steps to Solve  
1. **Explain why**  
   - Say that when you square any real number (positive or negative) the result is always **non‑negative** (zero or positive).  
   - Because of that, a square root of a negative number can never be a real number.  
2. **Give an example**  
   - Pick a negative number, e.g., **−9**.  
   - Show that no real number x satisfies \(x^2 = -9\).  
   - Write the example: “√(−9) is not a real number.”

Example of a complete answer:  
> “We say square roots of negative numbers are not possible in real numbers because squaring any real number gives a non‑negative result.  
> Example: √(−9) has no real solution.”

## Common Mistakes  
- **Missing the example** – Some answers only said “no solution” but did not give a concrete number.  
- **Wrong wording** – “square ruler” or “square root 9 is no solutin” are confusing.  
- **Spelling and punctuation** – Make sure words are spelled correctly: “solution”, “real”, “negative”.  
- **Short dots (.)** – A single period does not answer the question.  

### Quick tip  
Write the sentence in two parts:  
1. *Why* (reason)  
2. *Example* (illustration)

## Keep Practicing  
You’re on the right track! Try writing the answer again, following the steps above. Keep up the good effort—practice makes it clearer!
