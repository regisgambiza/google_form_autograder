## Question 21: Define primary data.
**Correct Answer:** Collect it by my self
**Explanation / Steps:**
## Feedback  
Good effort everyone! The definition of primary data is **“data collected first‑hand by the researcher.”** You’re on the right track if you see the idea of gathering information directly from the source.

## Steps to Solve  
1. Identify the phrase that indicates *direct* or *first‑hand* collection.  
2. Match it with “by the researcher” to show ownership.  
3. Combine to get the concise definition.

## Common Mistakes  
- Saying the data comes *from someone else* (e.g., “data that is collected by someone else's”) flips the meaning.  
- Using vague phrases like “collected from the researchers themselves” muddles the idea that the researcher is the collector, not the source.

## Keep Practicing  
Focus on the words *directly* and *first‑hand*—they’re the key. Try re‑phrasing the definition in your own words to solidify the concept. You’ve got it!
