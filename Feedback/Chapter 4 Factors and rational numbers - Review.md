## Question 21: Define primary data.
**Correct Answer:** Collect it by my self
**Explanation / Steps:**
## Feedback  
Good job!  
You answered many of the questions correctly.  
The correct definition of **primary data** is:

> Data collected **first‑hand by the researcher**.

Some of your answers are almost perfect. For example,  
- “Data collected first‑hand by the researcher.”  
- “Data collected directly by the researcher.”  
These are the right ones.

## Steps to Solve  
1. Think of who collects the data.  
2. Remember the word “first‑hand” – it means the data comes straight from the person who collected it.  
3. Write the sentence:  
   “Data collected first‑hand by the researcher.”  

Keep it short and clear.

## Common Mistakes  
- Saying the data comes from **others** (e.g., “by someone else”).  
- Mixing up “first‑hand” with “hand‑written.”  
- Adding extra words that change the meaning (e.g., “for a specific purpose” is okay, but the core idea is “first‑hand by the researcher”).  

Example of a mistake:  
> “Data that is collected by someone else.”  
This is **secondary data**.

## Keep Practicing  
Try to write the definition in one sentence each time.  
You can do it! Keep up the good work.

## Question 23: Give one advantage of using secondary data.
**Correct Answer:** Quick
**Explanation / Steps:**
## Feedback  
Good job!  
You answered the question about secondary data correctly.  
The best answer is: **Save time and money.**  

## Steps to Solve  
1. Think about what “secondary data” means.  
2. It is data that already exists.  
3. Because it already exists, you do not have to collect it yourself.  
4. Not collecting it yourself means you use less time and less money.  

## Common Mistakes  
- **Misspelling words** – e.g., “reliay” instead of “reliable.”  
- **Adding extra words** that are not needed – e.g., “It is quick and cheap to obtain.” is okay, but you can keep it simple.

- **Wasting time writing long sentences.**  

## Keep Practicing  
Keep looking for short, clear answers.  
You can do it!

## Question 24: Give one disadvantage of using secondary data.
**Correct Answer:** Out dated
**Explanation / Steps:**
## Feedback  
Good job!  
You listed many good ideas. The correct answer is: **“Might not be up to date.”**  

## Steps to Solve  
1. Think about what *secondary data* means.  
2. Ask yourself: What could be a problem with using data that was collected before?  
3. The most common problem is that the data may be old.  
4. Say it simply: “Might not be up to date.”  

## Common Mistakes  
- **Adding extra words** that are not needed, like “slow” or “bad answers.”  
- **Using wrong grammar**: “It may not be a accurate, reliable or up to date.”  
- **Missing the key point**: If you only say “unreliable” you are okay, but the best answer focuses on the data being old.  
- **Typing errors**: “out dated” instead of “outdated.”  

## Keep Practicing  
You can do it! Keep looking for the main idea in a question. Keep your answer short and clear. Good luck!

## Question 25: Name one method of collecting data directly from people.
**Correct Answer:** Survey
**Explanation / Steps:**
## Feedback  
Good job!  
You answered many times with the word **Interview**.  
That is the correct answer to the question: “Name one method of collecting data directly from people.”

## Steps to Solve  
1. Think of a way you can ask people questions in person.  
2. The most common way is to talk to them face‑to‑face.  
3. This talking is called an **Interview**.  

## Common Mistakes  
- Writing “Questionnaire” or “Survey” instead of “Interview.”  
  - Example: “Questionnaire” is a written list of questions, not a direct talk.  
- Mixing several methods in one answer.  
  - Example: “Questionnaire or interview” is okay, but the question only needs one.  
- Misspelling the word.  
  - Example: “Questionaire” or “Questionnair” – remember the “i” after the “a”.  

## Keep Practicing  
Try to give one simple answer for each question.  
You can do it! Keep up the good work.

## Question 26: What is meant by a representative sample?
**Correct Answer:** Sample
**Explanation / Steps:**
## Feedback  
Good job!  
You tried your best to answer the question.

The right answer is: **A sample that reflects the characteristics of the whole population.**  
Many of you gave the correct idea, but some answers were incomplete or a bit confusing.

---

## Steps to Solve  
1. **Know the terms**  
   * *Population* = the whole group you want to learn about.  
   * *Sample* = a smaller part of that group that you actually look at.  

2. **Check the word “representative”**  
   * It means the sample looks like the whole group.  
   * It must have the same kinds of people, sizes, ages, etc. as the whole group.  

3. **Write it clearly**  
   * “A sample that reflects the characteristics of the whole population.”  
   * You can say “accurately reflects” or “fairly reflects.”  

---

## Common Mistakes  
| Wrong answer | Why it is wrong | Better version |
|--------------|----------------|----------------|
| “Sample” | Too short, no detail. | Add “that reflects the whole population.” |
| “Random” | Only tells how you choose, not what it means. | Say the sample must look like the whole group. |
| “A small group that shows the whole group fairly.” | “Shows” is vague. | Use “reflects the characteristics.” |
| “Hg” or “.” | Not an answer. | Write a clear sentence. |
| Misspellings (e.g., “popplation”) | Hard to read. | Spell “population.” |

---

## Keep Practicing  
Try to write the answer in your own words.  
If you can explain it to a friend, you really understand it.  
Keep practicing, and you will get even better!

## Question 27: State one advantage of random sampling.
**Correct Answer:** No bias
**Explanation / Steps:**
## Feedback  
Good job!  
The one best answer is: **“More representative.”**  
You can say that random sampling makes the sample look more like the whole group.

## Steps to Solve  
1. Read the question carefully.  
2. Think of one main benefit of random sampling.  
3. Keep the answer short and clear.  
4. Write the sentence.  
   *Example:* “More representative.”

## Common Mistakes  
- Writing many points or long sentences.  
  *Wrong:* “It reduces bias and gives a sample that is more likely to be representative.”  
- Using words that are not asked for, like “bias” or “fair.”  
  *Right:* Only say the single advantage.  
- Forgetting the word *representative*.  
  *Right:* “More representative.”  

## Keep Practicing  
Try to answer in one sentence next time. You can do it! Keep up the good work.

## Question 28: State one disadvantage of convenience sampling.
**Correct Answer:** bias
**Explanation / Steps:**
## Feedback  
Good job!  
The correct answer is **“Not representative.”**  

## Steps to Solve  
1. Think of what a “convenience sample” means.  
2. It is a sample taken from people who are easy to reach.  
3. Because it is easy to reach, it may not match the whole group.  
4. Therefore the main disadvantage is that it is **not representative** of all people.

## Common Mistakes  
- Saying “bias” or “sampling bias” only.  
  *Example:* “High risk of bias.”  
  This is true, but the key word the question wants is **not representative**.  
- Adding extra words that change the meaning.  
  *Example:* “Not fair, doesn’t show the whole group.”  
  It is still about being not representative, but it is not the simple answer asked for.  

## Keep Practicing  
You can do it! Keep looking for the simple answer that the teacher wants. Keep practicing, and you will get better and better.

## Question 29: Give an example of discrete data.
**Correct Answer:** Number of goal
**Explanation / Steps:**
## Feedback  
Good job! You tried many good examples.  
The question was: “Give an example of discrete data.”  
The best answer is **Number of students** (or any other whole number you can count).

## Steps to Solve  
1. **Know what “discrete data” means.**  
   * It is data that can be counted in whole numbers.  
   * You can only have 1, 2, 3… not 1.5 or 2.3.  

2. **Think of something you can count.**  
   * Count the students in a class.  
   * Count the goals in a football match.  
   * Count the cars in a parking lot.  

3. **Write the answer.**  
   * “Number of students” is a short and clear way to say it.  

## Common Mistakes  
* **Using continuous data** – e.g., height, weight, or temperature. These can have decimals, so they are not discrete.  
* **Writing too long or vague** – e.g., “Things you can count, like goals or students.”  Keep it simple.  
* **Mixing up with continuous data** – “Number of cars in a car park” is okay, but remember cars are whole numbers, not fractions.

## Keep Practicing  
Try writing 3 more examples of discrete data on a sheet. You can say:  
- Number of books on a shelf  
- Number of pets a person has  
- Number of cars in a parking lot  

Keep practicing and you will get even better!

---

## Question 30: Give an example of continuous data.
**Correct Answer:** D
**Explanation / Steps:**
## Feedback  
Good job! You gave many good examples of continuous data. The best answer is **Height**.  

## Steps to Solve  
1. Think of something you can measure.  
2. The measurement can have many possible values (e.g., 170.2cm, 170.25cm).  
3. That means it is **continuous** data.  
4. Height, weight, temperature, and time are all good examples.  

## Common Mistakes  
- Writing “the number of students in a class” – that is a count, not a measurement.  
- Forgetting the word “continuous” – the data must be able to take any value in a range.  
- Mixing up continuous with discrete data (e.g., number of books, number of cars).  

## Keep Practicing  
You are on the right track. Keep thinking of things you can measure, and you’ll be great at spotting continuous data! Keep practicing!
