## Key Concepts
- **Minute Hand Position:** At 3o’clock the minute hand is on the 12, pointing straight up.  
- **Hour Hand Position:** The hour hand is exactly on the 3, which is 90° clockwise from the 12.  
- **Angle Calculation:** The smaller angle between two hands is simply the difference in their positions. 90° – 0° = **90°**.  
- **Units Matter:** Always express the answer in degrees (°) unless a different unit is specified.

## Common Challenges
- **Confusing 45° Answers:** A 45° angle would occur at about 1:15, not at 3:00.  
- **Ignoring the Minute Hand’s Position:** Some wrote 90° for the hour hand alone, forgetting the minute hand’s location.  
- **Using “East” or “90 c”:** These are not standard angle descriptions.  
- **Zero or 30° Answers:** These result from misreading the clock face or thinking the hour hand is at the top.

## Tips to Improve
1. **Visualize the Clock Face:** Picture or sketch the 12, 3, 6, and 9 points; the hour hand on 3 is exactly a quarter circle from the top.  
2. **Use the Formula:**  
   \[
   \text{Angle} = |30H - 5.5M|
   \]  
   For 3o’clock, \(H = 3, M = 0\), giving \( |90 - 0| = 90^\circ \).  
3. **Check Units:** Add the degree symbol (°) to avoid ambiguity.  
4. **Practice Variations:** Try 4:00, 6:00, 9:00, and random times to reinforce the pattern.

## Keep Going!
Great job identifying 90° as the main answer! Keep practicing with different times—each new angle will reinforce how the hands move relative to each other. Remember, the key is to picture the clock, use the formula, and always state the unit. You’re on the right track!
