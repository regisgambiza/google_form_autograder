## Question 2: How many lines of symmetry does a regular hexagon have? (MULTIPLE_CHOICE)
**Correct Answer:** 6  
**Explanation / Steps:**  
1. A regular hexagon has 6 equal sides and angles.  
2. Each side can be matched with another side if we fold the shape along a line that goes through the center.  
3. There are 6 such lines: 3 that go through opposite vertices, and 3 that go through the midpoints of opposite sides.  

## Feedback  
Great job! Most of you chose the right answer of 6.  

## Common Mistakes  
- Thinking there are only 3 lines of symmetry (missing the vertex-to-vertex lines).  
- Answering 4 instead of 6, perhaps mixing up with a different shape.  
- Choosing 3, maybe counting only one set of symmetry lines.  

## Keep Practicing  
Keep looking at the shape and see how many ways it can fold onto itself. Remember, for a regular hexagon it’s always 6!

## Question 3: A square has rotational symmetry of order? (MULTIPLE_CHOICE)
**Correct Answer:** 4  
**Explanation / Steps:**  
1. A square looks the same when rotated.  
2. How many times can you rotate it in a full 360° turn so it still matches?  
3. Rotating a square 90°, 180°, 270°, and 360° (back to start) works.  
4. That is 4 rotations, so the order of rotational symmetry is 4.  

## Feedback  
Great job! Most of you answered correctly with a 4. Keep up the good work with symmetry questions.

## Common Mistakes  
- Thinking the square has 6 rotations instead of 4.  
- Confusing rotational symmetry with reflection symmetry.  

## Keep Practicing  
Practice counting the rotations for other shapes like triangles and hexagons. Remember to check how many times the shape lines up with itself before it completes a full circle.

## Question 4: Which quadrilateral has exactly one line of symmetry? (MULTIPLE_CHOICE)
**Correct Answer:** Isosceles trapezium  
**Explanation / Steps:**  
- A line of symmetry means the shape can be folded so that the two halves match.  
- In a trapezium, if the two non‑parallel sides are equal (isosceles), there is one vertical line that divides it into two equal parts.  
- A kite has two lines of symmetry.  
- A rhombus or parallelogram has either two or none.  
- Therefore only the isosceles trapezium has exactly one line of symmetry.

## Feedback  
Great effort on the quiz! Many of you picked "Kite" or other shapes, but the correct answer is **Isosceles trapezium**. You’re doing well in recognizing shapes; just remember the symmetry rule for each type.

## Common Mistakes  
- Thinking a kite has only one line of symmetry.  
- Choosing rhombus or parallelogram because they are also quadrilaterals.  
- Overlooking that the trapezium’s sides need to be equal for the single symmetry line.

## Keep Practicing  
Try drawing each shape and marking all possible lines of symmetry. The more you see them, the easier it will be to remember which shape has exactly one!

## Question 5: A regular pentagon has rotational symmetry of order? (MULTIPLE_CHOICE)
**Correct Answer:** 5  
**Explanation / Steps:**  
- A regular pentagon has 5 equal sides.  
- Rotating it by 360°/5 = 72° keeps it looking the same.  
- Each 72° turn is one rotational symmetry.  
- There are 5 such turns (0°, 72°, 144°, 216°, 288°).  
- So the order of rotational symmetry is **5**.  

## Feedback  
Great job! Most of you chose the correct answer. Keep up the good work.  

## Common Mistakes  
- Thinking a 4‑fold symmetry is enough (4).  
- Confusing the number of sides with the number of rotations (3 or 2).  

## Keep Practicing  
Try drawing a pentagon and counting how many times you can rotate it before it looks the same. You’ll get even faster next time!

## Question 6: Which polygon has 10 equal sides and 10 equal angles? (MULTIPLE_CHOICE)
**Correct Answer:** Decagon  
**Explanation / Steps:**  
- A polygon has equal sides and equal angles.  
- Count the sides: the word “Decagon” means 10 sides.  
- Therefore a shape with 10 equal sides and 10 equal angles is a Decagon.  

## Feedback  
Great job to everyone who answered Decagon! You understood that the name of the shape tells you how many sides it has.  

## Common Mistakes  
- Saying “Heptagon” (7 sides) instead of Decagon.  
- Choosing “Octagon” (8 sides) or “Dodecagon” (12 sides) because of confusion with other names.  

## Keep Practicing  
Keep looking at the name of the shape; it tells you the number of sides. Try drawing a Decagon to see all 10 sides and angles are equal.

## Question 7: How many lines of symmetry does an equilateral triangle have? (MULTIPLE_CHOICE)
**Correct Answer:** 3  
**Explanation / Steps:**  
1. Look at an equilateral triangle.  
2. A line of symmetry cuts the shape into two equal halves that match when flipped.  
3. In an equilateral triangle, each vertex can be matched with the midpoint of the opposite side.  
4. There are three vertices, so there are three such lines.  
5. Therefore, the triangle has 3 lines of symmetry.

## Feedback  
Great job! Most of you answered **3**, which is correct. Keep up the good work!

## Common Mistakes  
- Thinking the triangle has only 1 line of symmetry.  
- Choosing 2 or 6 lines instead of 3.

## Keep Practicing  
Try drawing an equilateral triangle and drawing the lines yourself. Seeing them will help you remember that there are exactly three.

## Question 8: A rectangle has how many lines of symmetry? (MULTIPLE_CHOICE)
**Correct Answer:** 2  
**Explanation / Steps:**  
- A rectangle is a shape with two pairs of equal sides.  
- Lines of symmetry reflect the shape onto itself.  
- In a rectangle, you can draw a line through the middle of two opposite sides.  
- You can do this for the top-bottom pair and the left-right pair.  
- That gives 2 lines of symmetry.  

## Feedback  
Great job! Most of you answered the correct number of lines of symmetry. Keep up the good work!  

## Common Mistakes  
- Thinking a rectangle has 4 lines of symmetry.  
- Confusing a rectangle with a square.

## Keep Practicing  
Try drawing a rectangle and sketch the symmetry lines yourself. This will help you see the lines clearly.

## Question 9: Which shape has no lines of symmetry but rotational symmetry order 2? (MULTIPLE_CHOICE)
**Correct Answer:** Parallelogram  
**Explanation / Steps:**  
1. A shape with *rotational symmetry order 2* can be turned 180° and look the same.  
2. A shape with *no lines of symmetry* has no straight line that can fold the shape onto itself.  
3. A parallelogram fits both: it looks the same after a 180° rotation, but you cannot draw a line that splits it into two identical halves.  
4. Therefore the answer is a parallelogram.  

## Feedback  
Great job! Many of you chose the correct answer, which shows you understand the difference between rotation and reflection symmetry.  

## Common Mistakes  
- Choosing **trapezium** or **isosceles triangle** because they also have some symmetry, but not exactly the combination asked.  
- Choosing **circle** because circles have rotational symmetry, but they actually have infinitely many lines of symmetry, not none.  

## Keep Practicing  
Keep looking for the two clues: *no reflection lines* and *a 180° rotation that works*. Practice with different shapes to spot these features quickly!

## Question 10: The order of rotational symmetry of a regular nonagon is? (MULTIPLE_CHOICE)
**Correct Answer:** 9  
**Explanation / Steps:**  
- A regular nonagon has 9 equal sides and 9 vertices.  
- Rotational symmetry means the shape can be turned and still look the same.  
- In one full rotation (360°), the nonagon can line up with itself 9 times.  
- Each turn is 360° ÷ 9 = 40°.  
- Therefore, the order of rotational symmetry is **9**.  

## Feedback  
Great job! Most of you got the answer right. Keep using the 360° ÷ n method to find rotational symmetry for any regular polygon.

## Common Mistakes  
- Some answered **10**, maybe because they mixed up the number of sides with symmetry.  
- Others answered **6** or **8**, possibly confusing the nonagon with a hexagon or octagon.  
- A few wrote **10** again, showing a pattern of thinking “add 1” instead of using the division rule.

## Keep Practicing  
Try a quick test: find the rotational symmetry of a regular hexagon (hint: 360° ÷ 6). Keep checking your work with the 360° ÷ n rule!

## Question 11: A regular polygon has all sides and angles equal. (MULTIPLE_CHOICE)
**Correct Answer:** Correct  
**Explanation / Steps:**  
A regular polygon is a shape where every side is the same length and every interior angle is the same. So if you see all sides equal and all angles equal, it is a regular polygon.  

## Feedback  
Great job on most of the answers! You’re getting the concept of regular polygons right.  

## Common Mistakes  
- Thinking only the sides need to be equal, not the angles.  
- Mixing up regular and irregular polygons.  

## Keep Practicing  
Keep looking at shapes and check both sides and angles to confirm they’re all equal. You’re doing well—just keep practicing!

## Question 12: A rectangle always has rotational symmetry of order 4. (MULTIPLE_CHOICE)
**Correct Answer:** Wrong  
**Explanation / Steps:**  
1. A rectangle has two pairs of equal sides.  
2. When you rotate a rectangle 90°, the longer side becomes the shorter side.  
3. The shape does not look the same as the original rectangle.  
4. Therefore a rectangle does NOT have rotational symmetry of order 4.  

## Feedback  
Great job on reviewing the symmetry concepts! Keep thinking about how shapes look after rotations.

## Common Mistakes  
- Assuming all rectangles are the same as squares.  
- Forgetting that 90° rotation changes the orientation of the sides.

## Keep Practicing  
Try rotating different rectangles by 90°, 180°, and 270° to see which ones match the original shape. Happy learning!

## Question 13: A rhombus always has 2 lines of symmetry. (MULTIPLE_CHOICE)
**Correct Answer:** Correct  
**Explanation / Steps:**  
1. A rhombus is a quadrilateral with all sides equal.  
2. The diagonals of a rhombus cross at right angles and bisect each other.  
3. Each diagonal divides the rhombus into two equal mirror‑image halves.  
4. Therefore, a rhombus always has exactly two lines of symmetry – the two diagonals.  

## Feedback  
Great job! Most of you got it right. A few of you answered incorrectly, but that’s okay – it’s a good chance to review the idea of symmetry lines.  

## Common Mistakes  
- Thinking a rhombus has more than two lines of symmetry.  
- Confusing a rhombus with a square or an equilateral triangle, which have more symmetry lines.  
- Forgetting that the symmetry lines are the diagonals, not the sides.  

## Keep Practicing  
Keep checking the shape’s diagonals when you’re unsure. Every time you look at a rhombus, try to draw its diagonals and see the mirror halves. Good work!

## Question 14: A kite always has exactly 2 equal sides. (MULTIPLE_CHOICE)
**Correct Answer:** Wrong  
**Explanation / Steps:**  
1. A kite has four sides.  
2. In a kite, two pairs of adjacent sides are equal.  
3. Therefore, there are **four** sides that are equal in pairs, not just two.  
4. So the statement “A kite always has exactly 2 equal sides” is incorrect.  

## Feedback  
Great job to those who answered correctly! It looks like many of you got it right, but some still found it tricky. Keep looking at the shape’s sides carefully.  

## Common Mistakes  
- Thinking a kite only has one pair of equal sides.  
- Confusing the kite with other shapes that have only two equal sides.  
- Reading the phrase “exactly 2 equal sides” as meaning “only two sides are equal” instead of “two pairs of equal sides.”  

## Keep Practicing  
Try drawing a kite and labeling each side. Check the pairs to see how many equal sides you get. With practice, spotting those pairs will become second nature!

## Question 15: An equilateral triangle has 2 lines of symmetry. (MULTIPLE_CHOICE)
**Correct Answer:** Wrong  
**Explanation / Steps:**  
1. Look at an equilateral triangle.  
2. Draw a line from each vertex to the midpoint of the opposite side.  
3. There are 3 such lines.  
4. Each line splits the triangle into two mirror‑image halves.  
5. Therefore an equilateral triangle has **3** lines of symmetry, not 2.  

## Feedback  
Great effort on trying this question! I see you got it right in a few cases, and you’re on the right track by thinking about symmetry. Keep up the good work—just remember to check all three vertices!

## Common Mistakes  
- Thinking an equilateral triangle only has 2 lines, like an isosceles triangle.  
- Forgetting to draw a line from the third vertex.  
- Mixing up the number of sides with the number of symmetry lines.

## Keep Practicing  
Try drawing each line of symmetry on a paper triangle. Seeing all three lines will help you remember that the answer is “Wrong.” Keep practicing, and you’ll master symmetry in no time!

## Question 16: A circle has infinite lines of symmetry. (MULTIPLE_CHOICE)
**Correct Answer:** Correct  
**Explanation / Steps:**  
- A line of symmetry divides a shape into two halves that match.  
- A circle is round and looks the same from every angle.  
- Because you can draw a line through the center in any direction and the two halves will still match, the circle has *infinite* lines of symmetry.  

## Feedback  
Great job! Most of you answered correctly. Those who chose "Wrong" may have forgotten that a circle is symmetrical in every direction. Keep up the good work!  

## Common Mistakes  
- Thinking a circle has only a few lines of symmetry or none at all.  
- Confusing symmetry with a shape having a single special line (like a square).  
- Overlooking that symmetry lines can be in any direction for a circle.  

## Keep Practicing  
Look at circles and other round objects around you; try drawing a line through the center in different directions and notice the halves match. Keep exploring symmetry in all shapes—you’re doing great!

## Question 17: A parallelogram has no line of symmetry. (MULTIPLE_CHOICE)
**Correct Answer:** Correct  
**Explanation / Steps:**  
- A parallelogram has opposite sides that are equal and parallel.  
- To have a line of symmetry, the shape would need to mirror itself perfectly across that line.  
- A standard parallelogram does not satisfy this – only a rectangle or square would.  
- Therefore the statement “A parallelogram has no line of symmetry” is true.

## Feedback  
Great job, many of you answered correctly! It’s easy to mix up parallelograms with rectangles, but you’re getting the hang of it. Keep up the good work!

## Common Mistakes  
- Thinking all parallelograms look the same as rectangles.  
- Forgetting that a line of symmetry must split the shape into mirror‑image halves.  
- Mixing up “rotational symmetry” with “reflection symmetry”.

## Keep Practicing  
Try drawing different parallelograms and see if you can find any lines that would make them look the same on both sides. Keep exploring, and you’ll master symmetry in no time!

## Question 18: An isosceles triangle has only 1 line of symmetry. (MULTIPLE_CHOICE)
**Correct Answer:** Correct  
**Explanation / Steps:**  
- An isosceles triangle has two equal sides.  
- The line that goes from the vertex between the equal sides to the midpoint of the base is a symmetry line.  
- Reflecting the triangle across this line gives the same shape.  
- Therefore, there is exactly **1** line of symmetry.  

## Feedback  
Great job to everyone who answered correctly! You’ve remembered that an isosceles triangle has one symmetry line. Keep up the good work and check the other shapes you’ve studied too.

## Common Mistakes  
- Thinking an isosceles triangle has **2** symmetry lines.  
- Thinking it has **0** symmetry lines.  
- Confusing an isosceles triangle with a scalene triangle.

## Keep Practicing  
Try drawing different triangles and marking their symmetry lines. The more you practice, the easier it will be to spot them!

## Question 19: A square and a rhombus have the same number of lines of symmetry. (MULTIPLE_CHOICE)
**Correct Answer:** Wrong  
**Explanation / Steps:**  
1. A square has 4 lines of symmetry (two diagonals and two mid‑line cuts).  
2. A rhombus usually has only 2 lines of symmetry (its two diagonals).  
3. Since 4 ≠ 2, the square and the rhombus do **not** have the same number of lines of symmetry.  
4. Therefore the statement is **Wrong**.  

## Feedback  
Great effort! You answered correctly in several cases. Keep practicing counting symmetry lines—it's a useful skill for all shapes.  

## Common Mistakes  
- Thinking a rhombus has 4 symmetry lines.  
- Assuming a square only has 2 symmetry lines.  
- Mixing up the symmetry of a rhombus with that of a square.  

## Keep Practicing  
Try drawing each shape and drawing the symmetry lines yourself. The more you practice, the easier it will become to spot the differences!

## Question 20: A regular hexagon has rotational symmetry of order 6. (MULTIPLE_CHOICE)
**Correct Answer:** Correct  
**Explanation / Steps:**  
1. A regular hexagon has 6 equal sides.  
2. When you rotate it, the shape looks the same each time you turn it 60°.  
3. 360° ÷ 60° = 6.  
4. Therefore, there are 6 rotations that map the hexagon onto itself.  
5. The rotational symmetry order is 6.  

## Feedback  
Great job! Most of you got it right. Keep up the good work.

## Common Mistakes  
- Thinking the symmetry order is 12 instead of 6.  
- Confusing rotational symmetry with reflection symmetry.  
- Forgetting to divide 360° by the angle of one step (60°).

## Keep Practicing  
Try drawing a hexagon and marking the rotation points. Remember, each 60° turn is one of the 6 symmetrical positions.

## Question 21: Name a polygon with 7 sides. (SHORT_ANSWER)
**Correct Answer:** Heptagon  
**Explanation / Steps:**  
1. Count the sides of the shape.  
2. A polygon with 7 sides is called a heptagon.  

## Feedback  
Great job! Most of you answered correctly. Keep up the good work!  

## Common Mistakes  
- Misspelling it as “Septagon.”  
- Naming a different polygon, like “Pentagon.”  
- Writing unrelated words such as “Love” or numbers like “3.”  

## Keep Practicing  
Try practicing with other numbers of sides. Remember: 3‑sides = triangle, 4‑sides = quadrilateral, 5‑sides = pentagon, 6‑sides = hexagon, 7‑sides = heptagon, 8‑sides = octagon, 9‑sides = nonagon, 10‑sides = decagon. Good luck!

## Question 22: How many equal angles are in a regular octagon? (SHORT_ANSWER)
**Correct Answer:** 8  
**Explanation / Steps:**  
A regular octagon has 8 sides.  
Each side meets another side at an angle.  
All 8 of these angles are the same.  
Therefore, there are 8 equal angles.

## Feedback  
Great job! Most of your answers were correct. You clearly understand that a regular octagon has eight equal angles. Keep up the good work!

## Common Mistakes  
- Counting the wrong number of angles (e.g., 10, 9, 3).  
- Confusing the number of sides with the number of angles.  
- Typos or misspellings like “Gight” instead of “eight”.

## Keep Practicing  
Try drawing a regular octagon on paper and labeling each angle. This will help you see that there are exactly eight angles. Keep practicing, and you'll master symmetry even faster!

## Question 23: What is the order of rotational symmetry of a square? (SHORT_ANSWER)
**Correct Answer:** 4  
**Explanation / Steps:**  
1. A square looks the same after rotating it.  
2. Count how many times it matches itself before returning to the starting position.  
3. A square matches itself at 0°, 90°, 180°, and 270°.  
4. That is 4 times, so the order of rotational symmetry is 4.  

## Feedback  
Great job! Most of you answered “4” correctly. A few of you gave other numbers or extra words. Remember the simple rule: count the times a shape fits back on itself when you spin it.  

## Common Mistakes  
- Writing numbers like 2, 3, 1, or 8 instead of 4.  
- Adding extra information that is not the symmetry order (e.g., “Isosceles trapezium”).  
- Mixing up degrees with the count (e.g., “90 degrees, 4 rotational symmetry”).  

## Keep Practicing  
Keep looking at how many times a shape repeats when you rotate it. Try the same with a triangle or a rectangle to see the difference. Good work!

## Question 24: Draw and label a polygon with exactly one line of symmetry. (SHORT_ANSWER)
**Correct Answer:** Isosceles triangle  
**Explanation / Steps:**  
1. A line of symmetry is a line that splits a shape into two mirror‑image halves.  
2. An isosceles triangle has two equal sides and one base.  
3. The line drawn from the top vertex to the middle of the base makes the two halves identical.  
4. No other line in that triangle gives a mirror image, so it has exactly one line of symmetry.

## Feedback  
Great job to everyone who answered “Isosceles triangle”! You got the right shape that has only one line of symmetry.  
If you said “kite,” “trapezoid,” or another shape, remember that those shapes can have more than one symmetry line.  
Keep practicing drawing shapes and checking how many lines of symmetry they have.

## Common Mistakes  
- Thinking a kite has only one line of symmetry (kites usually have two).  
- Confusing an isosceles trapezoid with the triangle; the trapezoid has two symmetry lines.  
- Not answering or answering with random words instead of a shape.

## Keep Practicing  
Try drawing several different triangles and decide how many lines of symmetry each has. A quick check will help you spot the correct shape next time!

## Question 25: Name the polygon that becomes more like a circle as sides increase. (SHORT_ANSWER)
**Correct Answer:** An aepirogon  
**Explanation / Steps:**  
1. Think about a polygon with many sides.  
2. When the number of sides gets very large, the shape looks more like a circle.  
3. A shape that has an infinite number of sides is called an **apeirogon** (spelled “aepirogon” in the answer).  
4. Therefore the polygon that becomes more like a circle as sides increase is an apeirogon.  

## Feedback  
Great effort on thinking of many polygons! You got the idea that more sides mean a shape closer to a circle. Just remember the special name for a shape with infinitely many sides: an apeirogon.

## Common Mistakes  
- Thinking any regular polygon (octagon, decagon, etc.) is the answer.  
- Calling the shape a “circle” instead of a polygon.  
- Missing the word “apeirogon” or spelling it incorrectly.

## Keep Practicing  
Keep exploring how changing the number of sides affects a shape. Next time, look for the word that describes an infinite‑sided polygon!

## Question 26: State the number of lines of symmetry of an equilateral triangle. (SHORT_ANSWER)
**Correct Answer:** 3  
**Explanation / Steps:**  
1. An equilateral triangle has three equal sides.  
2. Each side can be the base of a line that divides the triangle into two mirror‑image halves.  
3. Therefore there are 3 such lines, one through each vertex to the opposite side.  

## Feedback  
Great job! You did well by noting that an equilateral triangle has 3 lines of symmetry. Keep checking each vertex and its opposite side – that’s the key idea.

## Common Mistakes  
- Thinking the triangle has only 1 or 2 lines of symmetry.  
- Confusing the shape with a parallelogram or a different type of triangle.  
- Writing “Three line of symmetry” instead of “Three lines of symmetry.”  

## Keep Practicing  
Try drawing an equilateral triangle and shading one half; then mirror it to see the symmetry. This will help you see all three lines clearly. Keep up the good work!

## Question 27: Which quadrilateral has no line of symmetry but rotational symmetry order 2? (SHORT_ANSWER)
**Correct Answer:** Parallelogram  
**Explanation / Steps:**  
1. Look for a shape that can be rotated 180° and look the same.  
2. A parallelogram turns into itself after 180° rotation.  
3. Check for reflection lines: a general parallelogram has none.  
4. So a parallelogram has rotational symmetry of order 2 but no line of symmetry.

## Feedback  
Great job! Many of you answered “Parallelogram” correctly. Keep up the good work and double‑check your spelling to make it look even better.

## Common Mistakes  
- Writing “Circle” instead of a quadrilateral.  
- Confusing the parallelogram with a rhombus, rectangle, or square, which do have extra symmetries.  
- Spelling errors such as “Paralelogram” or “Paralellagram”.

## Keep Practicing  
Try drawing different quadrilaterals and marking their symmetry lines. This will help you spot which ones have only rotational symmetry. Good luck!

## Question 28: A regular decagon has how many lines of symmetry? (SHORT_ANSWER)
**Correct Answer:** 10  
**Explanation / Steps:**  
1. A decagon has 10 sides.  
2. A regular polygon has one line of symmetry for each side.  
3. Therefore a regular decagon has 10 lines of symmetry.  

## Feedback  
Great job to everyone who answered **10**! You’ve got the right idea that each side of a regular decagon gives one symmetry line.  
For those who wrote a different number, double‑check the number of sides in a decagon—remember it has 10, not 8 or 5.

## Common Mistakes  
- Thinking a decagon is an octagon (8 sides) and counting 8 lines.  
- Counting only half of the sides or missing some lines.  
- Writing “line” instead of “lines” and giving a vague answer.

## Keep Practicing  
Keep reviewing the number of sides for different polygons; each side equals one symmetry line in a regular shape. Good luck!

## Question 29: Which polygon has 4 pairs of parallel sides? (SHORT_ANSWER)
**Correct Answer:** Octagon  
**Explanation / Steps:**  
1. Each pair of parallel sides uses two sides.  
2. Four pairs of parallel sides mean 4 × 2 = 8 sides.  
3. The only regular polygon with 8 sides is an octagon.  

## Feedback  
Great job to those who answered *Octagon*! You correctly counted the sides that can form parallel pairs. For the others, remember that a parallelogram or square only has two pairs of parallel sides, so they don’t meet the requirement of four pairs.

## Common Mistakes  
- Thinking a **square** or **parallelogram** has four pairs of parallel sides (they only have two).  
- Answering with the wrong word spelling or a different shape (e.g., **decagon**, **pentagon**).  
- Confusing the question with “number of sides” rather than “pairs of parallel sides”.

## Keep Practicing  
Keep practicing by drawing polygons and counting how many pairs of sides can be parallel. Each time you find four pairs, you’ve found an octagon!

## Question 30: A regular pentagon has how many lines of symmetry? (SHORT_ANSWER)
**Correct Answer:** 5  
**Explanation / Steps:**  
A regular pentagon looks the same when you flip it over each of its five symmetry lines.  
Count the lines that cut the shape into two mirror‑image halves.  
For a regular pentagon there are 5 such lines.

## Feedback  
Great job! Many of you answered correctly. You’ve shown you understand how a regular pentagon has 5 lines of symmetry. Keep up the good work!

## Common Mistakes  
- Some answers were 1, 3, or 4, which shows a mix‑up in counting symmetry lines.  
- A few wrote “5 line” or “5 lines” instead of the full phrase, so double‑check your wording.  
- A few students gave unrelated information (e.g., about octagons) which means the question might not have been read carefully.

## Keep Practicing  
Try drawing a regular pentagon and marking each symmetry line yourself. Seeing them will help you remember that there are exactly 5 of them. Happy learning!
