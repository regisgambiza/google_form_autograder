## Question 21: Name a polygon with 7 sides.
**Correct Answer:** Heptagon
**Explanation / Steps:**
## Feedback  
Good job!  
The answer you need is **Heptagon**.  
You wrote it many times, and most of them are right.  

## Steps to Solve  
1. Think about the number of sides.  
2. Count: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, **7**.  
3. The word for 7 sides is **Heptagon**.  
4. Write the word exactly: Heptagon (capital H, no extra spaces).  

## Common Mistakes  
- **Extra spaces**: “Heptagon “ or “ Heptagon” – clean up the spaces.  
- **Wrong spelling**: “Septagon” – the letter **e** is wrong.  
- **Wrong polygon**: “Pentagon” (5 sides), “Decagon” (10 sides) – remember 7 sides.  
- **Case**: “heptagon” (lowercase) is fine in writing, but in the answer key it is shown as Heptagon.  
- **Wrong answer**: “Love” – that is not a polygon!  

## Keep Practicing  
Keep checking the spelling and the number of sides. You can do it!

## Question 22: How many equal angles are in a regular octagon?
**Correct Answer:** 8
**Explanation / Steps:**
## Feedback  
Good job!  
You can see that **8** is the right answer.  

## Steps to Solve  
1. A regular octagon has 8 sides.  
2. Each side has one interior angle.  
3. In a regular shape all interior angles are the same.  
4. Therefore, there are 8 equal angles.  

## Common Mistakes  
- **Thinking the number of angles is the same as the sum of angles** (e.g., 10, 9, 6, 4).  
- **Counting the wrong shape** (mixing up a triangle or a square).  
- **Mis‑spelling** (like “Gight”).  
- **Using a wrong formula** that gives 135° for one angle but not the count of angles.  

## Keep Practicing  
You did well! Keep looking at the shape’s sides and remember that each side gives one equal angle. You can do it!

## Question 23: What is the order of rotational symmetry of a square?
**Correct Answer:** 4
**Explanation / Steps:**
## Feedback  
Good job to everyone who answered “4”!  
The right answer is **4**.

## Steps to Solve  
1. A square can be turned (rotated) and still look the same.  
2. The square can stay the same after turning 90°, 180°, 270°, and 360°.  
3. That gives 4 different positions.  
4. So the order of rotational symmetry is **4**.

## Common Mistakes  
- **Answering “2” or “1”** – you may have counted only 180° or 360°.  
- **Answering “3” or “8”** – you might have mixed up the angles.  
- **Adding extra words** – saying “90 degrees, 4 rotational symmetry” is okay, but just “4” is clearer.  
- **Wrong shape** – “Isosceles trapezium” is a different figure, not a square.

## Keep Practicing  
You can do it! Keep looking at how many turns keep the figure unchanged. Good luck!

## Question 24: Draw and label a polygon with exactly one line of symmetry.
**Correct Answer:** Kite
**Explanation / Steps:**
## Feedback  
Good job to everyone who answered **isosceles triangle**!  
You are right – an isosceles triangle has exactly one line of symmetry.

## Steps to Solve  
1. **Draw a triangle.**  
2. **Make two sides the same length.**  
3. **Mark the middle point of the base.**  
4. **Draw a straight line from the top vertex to that middle point.**  
5. The line you drew is the line of symmetry.  
6. Label the triangle and the line if the teacher asks.

## Common Mistakes  
- **Calling it a kite.** A kite has two pairs of equal sides and two lines of symmetry, not one.  
- **Wrong shape.** A square or regular polygon has many symmetry lines.  
- **Skipping the line.** The question asks you to *draw and label* the symmetry line.  
- **Misspelling.** “Isoceles” or “Isoscies” – remember it is **isosceles**.

## Keep Practicing  
Try drawing another isosceles triangle on a different piece of paper.  
You can also try an **isosceles trapezoid** – it also has only one symmetry line.  
Keep practicing, and you will get even better!

## Question 25: Name the polygon that becomes more like a circle as sides increase.
**Correct Answer:** Apeirogon
**Explanation / Steps:**
## Feedback

Good job on trying to answer the question!  
The correct answer is **an apeirogon** (a polygon with infinitely many sides).  
A regular polygon with more and more sides becomes more and more like a circle, but the shape that literally becomes a circle when the number of sides goes to infinity is called an apeirogon.

## Steps to Solve

1. **Read the question carefully.**  
   It asks which polygon becomes “more like a circle as sides increase.”  
2. **Think of a regular polygon.**  
   A square, triangle, hexagon, etc. all get closer to a circle as you add more sides.  
3. **Realize that “more like a circle” means “eventually a circle.”**  
   The only way to get exactly a circle is to have infinitely many sides.  
4. **Remember the word for that shape.**  
   It is called an **apeirogon** (pronounced “ape-yer-OG-uhn”).

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Why it’s wrong | Example |
|---------|----------------|---------|
| Saying **Decagon / Octagon / Hexagon** | These are just polygons with 10, 8, 6 sides. They look a bit rounder, but they are still polygons. | “Decagon becomes more like a circle” – it becomes rounder but never a circle. |
| Saying **Regular polygon** | Any regular polygon (triangle, square, pentagon, etc.) gets rounder, but the question wants the specific shape that *actually* becomes a circle. | “Regular polygon becomes a circle” – true in the limit, but the answer expects the name of that shape. |
| Saying **Circle** | A circle is not a polygon; it has no sides. | “Circle becomes more like a circle” – not a polygon at all. |
| Saying **None / idk** | You didn’t give an answer. | “None” – you didn’t try to answer. |
| Mis‑spelling **apeirogon** | Spelling matters. | “aperogon” or “aepirogon” – still the same idea but wrong spelling. |
| Making up weird names | “Infinitygon”, “Myriagon” – these are not the standard terms. | “Infinitygon” is not a known shape. |

## Keep Practicing

You are learning a new word that is useful in geometry.  
Try drawing a triangle, square, hexagon, and then imagine adding more sides.  
Notice how the shape gets rounder, and think of the limit when you could keep adding sides forever – that is an apeirogon.  

Keep practicing, and you will master these concepts in no time!

## Question 26: State the number of lines of symmetry of an equilateral triangle.
**Correct Answer:** 3
**Explanation / Steps:**
## Feedback  

Good job to everyone who wrote **3**!  
You answered the question correctly.  
Some of you wrote 1, 8, or 67 – that is not right for an equilateral triangle.  
Let’s see why 3 is the correct answer.

## Steps to Solve  

1. Look at an equilateral triangle.  
2. It has 3 equal sides.  
3. A line of symmetry goes from a vertex to the midpoint of the opposite side.  
4. Because the triangle is the same shape on both sides of that line, it is a symmetry line.  
5. There are 3 vertices, so you get 3 such lines.  
6. Therefore, an equilateral triangle has **3 lines of symmetry**.

## Common Mistakes  

- **Thinking only one line** – maybe you looked at just one vertex.  
- **Counting the sides instead of the lines** – sides are not symmetry lines.  
- **Confusing the shape** – remember that only an equilateral triangle has 3 equal sides.  
- **Wrong numbers (8, 67, etc.)** – those numbers belong to other shapes, not this triangle.

## Keep Practicing  

Try drawing a triangle and shading the symmetric halves.  
If you can do that, you’ll remember the 3 lines of symmetry.  
Keep up the good work! You can do it!

## Question 27: Which quadrilateral has no line of symmetry but rotational symmetry order 2?
**Correct Answer:** Pallelogram
**Explanation / Steps:**
## Feedback  
Good job!  
The correct answer is **Parallelogram**.  
A parallelogram has two pairs of parallel sides. It does **not** have a line of symmetry, but if you rotate it 180° (order2), it looks the same.  

## Steps to Solve  
1. Think of shapes that can be turned 180° and still look the same.  
2. Check if the shape can be reflected across a line and still look the same.  
3. A parallelogram turns 180° and stays the same, but you cannot reflect it to look the same.  
4. Therefore, it has rotational symmetry order2 but no line of symmetry.  

## Common Mistakes  
- **Saying “Circle”** – a circle has many lines of symmetry, not none.  
- **Answering “Rhombus” or “Rectangle”** – these shapes also have lines of symmetry.  
- **Misspelling “Parallelogram”** – writing “Paralellagram” or “Palallel…” is okay, but make sure you write the correct word.  

## Keep Practicing  
You are on the right track. Try more geometry questions about symmetry. You can do it!

## Question 28: A regular decagon has how many lines of symmetry?
**Correct Answer:** 10
**Explanation / Steps:**
## Feedback  
Good job to everyone who answered **10**!  
You did well by remembering that a regular decagon (10 sides) has 10 lines of symmetry.

If you answered **5**, **3**, **4**, **8**, **67**, or said **Octagon**, you might have mixed up the shape or the rule. Let’s look at how to find the answer correctly.

## Steps to Solve  
1. **Count the sides** of the regular polygon.  
2. For a *regular* polygon, the number of lines of symmetry equals the number of sides.  
3. A decagon has **10** sides → therefore **10** lines of symmetry.

## Common Mistakes  
| Mistake | Why it happens | Example |
|---------|----------------|---------|
| Mixing up the shape | Thinking the shape is an octagon (8 sides) or other polygon | Saying “Octagon” or “8” |
| Forgetting the rule | Not remembering that symmetry lines = sides for regular polygons | Saying “5” or “4” |
| Mis‑counting sides | Counting vertices or edges wrong | Saying “67” or “10 lines on symmetry” |

## Keep Practicing  
Keep checking the number of sides first, then remember the rule:  
**Regular polygon → symmetry lines = sides.**  
You can do it! Keep practicing with different shapes, and soon it will feel natural.

## Question 29: Which polygon has 4 pairs of parallel sides?
**Correct Answer:** Octagon
**Explanation / Steps:**
## Feedback  
Good job trying!  
The answer to the question **“Which polygon has 4 pairs of parallel sides?”** is **Octagon**.

## Steps to Solve  
1. **Remember** a pair of parallel sides means two sides that are in the same direction.  
2. **Count the pairs** you need: 4 pairs → 4 × 2 sides = 8 sides.  
3. **Look for a polygon with 8 sides**.  
4. An octagon has exactly 8 sides, so it can have 4 pairs of parallel sides.  

## Common Mistakes  
- **Thinking a square or parallelogram has 4 pairs**.  
  *A square has only 2 pairs of parallel sides (top/bottom and left/right).  
- **Mixing up the number of sides with the number of pairs**.  
  *A decagon has 10 sides → 5 pairs, not 4.  
- **Writing “4” or “None”** because they forgot that the question asks for a *polygon*, not a number.  

## Keep Practicing  
Keep looking at the shape and counting its sides. You can do it!

## Question 30: A regular pentagon has how many lines of symmetry?
**Correct Answer:** 5
**Explanation / Steps:**
## Feedback  
Good job to everyone who answered **5**!  
For those who wrote other numbers, let’s see why they were wrong.

## Steps to Solve  
1. A regular pentagon has 5 equal sides.  
2. A regular shape has a symmetry line through a vertex and the middle of the opposite side.  
3. There are 5 vertices, so there are 5 symmetry lines.  
4. The answer is **5**.

## Common Mistakes  
- **Answering 1, 2, 3, 4, 9, 10**:  
  These numbers are for other shapes (triangle, square, etc.).  
  A pentagon always has 5 lines, not 1 or 2.  
- **Writing “5 lines of symmetry” or “5 line”**:  
  That is fine, but remember the simple answer is just **5**.  
- **Thinking about parallel sides**:  
  The sentence “The polygon that has 4 pairs of parallel sides is an octagon” is about a different shape, not a pentagon.  

## Keep Practicing  
Keep looking at the shape and counting the vertices.  
You can do it!
