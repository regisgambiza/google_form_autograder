## Question 21: Name a polygon with 7 sides.
**Correct Answer:** Heptagon
**Explanation / Steps:**
## Feedback  
Good effort everyone! Most of you correctly identified the 7‑sided figure as a **heptagon**.  

## Steps to Solve  
1. Recall that polygon names use Greek number prefixes.  
2. “Seven” in Greek is **hept‑**.  
3. Combine with the suffix “‑gon” (polygon) → **heptagon**.  

## Common Mistakes  
- Some students wrote **Septagon**—while it’s understandable, the standard term is **heptagon**.  
- A few responses were misspelled or in all caps (“heptagon .”), and a handful named unrelated shapes (pentagon, decagon) or even “Love” and “3”.  

## Keep Practicing  
Keep reviewing the Greek prefixes (tri, tetra, penta, hexa, hept, oct, dec). A quick flashcard drill will solidify the spellings and help you avoid mix‑ups. Great work, and keep up the curiosity!

## Question 22: How many equal angles are in a regular octagon?
**Correct Answer:** 8
**Explanation / Steps:**
## Feedback  
Good effort everyone! Most of you got the correct answer—**8** equal angles. I see a few of you were off, so let’s clear up how we get to 8.

## Steps to Solve  
1. A regular octagon has **8 sides**.  
2. In any regular polygon, each interior angle is equal.  
3. Therefore, there are **8 equal interior angles**—one at each vertex.  
(If you want the measure: \( (180° \times (8-2))/8 = 135° \), but the question only asks how many.)

## Common Mistakes  
- **Counting wrong angles**: Some answered 10, 6, or 4, perhaps confusing sides with diagonals or miscounting vertices.  
- **Mixing interior/exterior angles**: Remember the question asks for interior angles, not the 8 exterior angles that sum to 360°.

## Keep Practicing  
Next time, double‑check whether the problem asks for sides, angles, or something else. Keep those mental checks handy, and you’ll nail it every time!
