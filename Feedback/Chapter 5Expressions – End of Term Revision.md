## Question 21: Simplify: 4x + 7 – 2x + 3.
**Correct Answer:** 2x+10
**Explanation / Steps:**
## Feedback  
Good job trying!  
The correct answer is **2x + 10**.

## Steps to Solve  
1. Look at the terms with *x*:  
   - 4x and – 2x  
2. Add them: 4x – 2x = 2x.  
3. Look at the numbers without *x*:  
   - 7 and + 3  
4. Add them: 7 + 3 = 10.  
5. Combine the two results: 2x + 10.

## Common Mistakes  
- **Adding the numbers first**: 7 + 3 = 10, then forgetting the *x* part.  
  *Wrong*: 10 + 4x – 2x = 10 (missing 2x).  
- **Multiplying the *x* terms**: 4x × 2x = 8x² (that is not what we do).  
- **Leaving out a sign**: writing 2x – 10 instead of 2x + 10.  
- **Mixing up the order**: 6x + 10 or 6x – 10 (wrong because 4x – 2x = 2x, not 6x).  

### Example of a correct rewrite  
`(4x – 2x) + (7 + 3) = 2x + 10`

## Keep Practicing  
Keep grouping like terms.  
Try another problem:  
Simplify: `3y – y + 5 – 2`.  
You can do it!

## Question 22: Expand: (y + 5)(y – 2).
**Correct Answer:** y² +3y
**Explanation / Steps:**
## Feedback  
Good job to everyone who got the answer right!  
The correct expanded form is **\(y^2 + 3y - 10\)**.  

## Steps to Solve  
1. Write the product: \((y + 5)(y - 2)\).  
2. Distribute the first term: \(y \times (y - 2) = y^2 - 2y\).  
3. Distribute the second term: \(5 \times (y - 2) = 5y - 10\).  
4. Add the two results:  
   \(y^2 - 2y + 5y - 10 = y^2 + 3y - 10\).  

## Common Mistakes  
| Mistake | Example | Why it’s wrong |
|---------|---------|----------------|
| Forgetting to multiply every term | “\(5y + -2y\)” | You must multiply both terms inside each parenthesis. |
| Missing the negative sign on \(-10\) | “\(y^2 + 3y - 1\)” | The product of 5 and -2 is -10, not -1. |
| Writing \(y^3\) or \(y^2\) with wrong powers | “\(y^3 + 3y - 10\)” | The highest power is 2, not 3. |
| Leaving out the “\(y\)” in the product | “\(Y3\)” or “\(Y^2 + 3y - 10\)” | It must read \(3y\), not just “3”. |
| Using only one part of the product | “\(y^2 - 10\)” | You omitted the middle terms from the distribution. |
| Mixing up the order of terms | “\(y^2 + 3y – 10\)” (with a space or wrong dash) | As long as the terms are correct, the order doesn’t matter, but keep the same symbols. |

## Keep Practicing  
Try another example: \((x - 4)(x + 6)\).  
Use the same steps: distribute, combine like terms, and you’ll get the right answer.  
You can do it—keep going!

## Question 23: Factorise: 20p + 30q.
**Correct Answer:** 10(2p+3q
**Explanation / Steps:**
## Feedback  
Good job! Many of you found the right answer: **10(2p + 3q)**.  
That is the correct way to factorise the expression 20p + 30q.

## Steps to Solve  
1. Look at each term in 20p + 30q.  
2. Find a number that divides both 20 and 30.  
3. The largest common number is 10.  
4. Write 10 in front: 10 × (something).  
5. Divide 20 by 10 → 2.  
6. Divide 30 by 10 → 3.  
7. Put the results together: 10(2p + 3q).

## Common Mistakes  
| Wrong answer | Why it is wrong | Example | Correct form |
|--------------|-----------------|---------|--------------|
| 3q | Only one term was written. | “3q” | 10(2p + 3q) |
| 50q | 20p + 30q was turned into 50q. | “50q” | 10(2p + 3q) |
| 10(20p+30q) | The 10 was written outside but the inside was not divided. | “10(20p+30q)” | 10(2p + 3q) |
| 10(2p+3p) | 3q was mistakenly written as 3p. | “10(2p+3p)” | 10(2p + 3q) |
| 5(4p+6q) | 10 was divided by 2 first, but the whole factorisation is still fine. | “5(4p+6q)” | 10(2p + 3q) |
| 10(2p+3) | The q was lost. | “10(2p+3)” | 10(2p + 3q) |

Common causes:  
- Forgetting to divide each coefficient by the common factor.  
- Missing the variable in the second term.  
- Adding or subtracting the terms instead of factoring.

## Keep Practicing  
Try another one: “Factorise 12x + 18y.”  
Remember the same steps: find the biggest common factor, pull it out, then divide the rest. You can do it!

## Question 24: Find the value of 2a² – 3b when a = 2, b = –1.
**Correct Answer:** 11
**Explanation / Steps:**
## Feedback  
Good job!  
You answered **11** – that is the correct answer. Great work!

## Steps to Solve  
1. Replace \(a\) with 2 and \(b\) with –1.  
2. Compute \(a^2\): \(2^2 = 4\).  
3. Multiply by 2: \(2 \times 4 = 8\).  
4. Compute \(-3b\): \(-3 \times (-1) = +3\).  
5. Add the two results: \(8 + 3 = 11\).  

So the value is **11**.

## Common Mistakes  
- **Wrong sign for \(b\)**: Some people forget that \(-3b\) becomes +3 when \(b\) is –1.  
  Example: \( -3 \times 1 = -3\) (wrong).  
- **Wrong exponent**: Forgetting to square \(a\).  
  Example: using \(2\) instead of \(4\).  
- **Missing a step**: Skipping the multiplication by 2.  

If you see these, double‑check the sign and the order of operations.

## Keep Practicing  
Keep trying these types of problems. You can do it!  
Happy learning!

## Question 25: Write an expression for “three times a number decreased by 7”.
**Correct Answer:** 3x-7
**Explanation / Steps:**
## Feedback  
Good job!  
Most of you wrote the right answer: **3n – 7** (or **3x – 7**).  
A few of you made small mistakes – that’s normal.  

## Steps to Solve  
1. **Read the phrase.**  
   “Three times a number” → multiply the number by 3.  
   → 3×(n)  →  **3n** (or **3x**).  

2. **Add the next part.**  
   “Decreased by 7” means subtract 7.  
   → 3n – 7  

So the expression is **3n – 7** (you can also write **3x – 7**).  

## Common Mistakes  
| Wrong answer | Why it’s wrong | Correct form |
|--------------|----------------|--------------|
| 3x + 7 | “Decreased by 7” is subtraction, not addition. | 3x – 7 |
| 7 – 3a | The order is reversed. | 3a – 7 |
| 3(n – 7) | This means three times “(number minus 7)”, not “three times a number then subtract 7”. | 3n – 7 |
| 3×7² or 3×7 – 1 | Uses numbers instead of a variable. | 3n – 7 |
| 3a + 7 | Wrong sign. | 3a – 7 |

### Quick tip  
Use any letter for the unknown (n, x, a). The key parts are:  
- **3** multiplied by the letter → 3n or 3x  
- **minus 7** after that → 3n – 7

## Keep Practicing  
Keep trying! Write the expression from the words again and check that you have “3×(variable) – 7”. You can do it!

## Question 26: Simplify: 2m + 3m – 4.
**Correct Answer:** 5m-4
**Explanation / Steps:**
## Feedback

Good job to everyone who answered the question!  
You only need to add the *m* terms and keep the constant the same.

The correct answer is:

**5m – 4**

---

## Steps to Solve

1. Look at the expression: **2m + 3m – 4**  
2. The terms that have *m* are **2m** and **3m**.  
3. Add them together: 2+3=5.  
4. Write the result with *m*: **5m**.  
5. The constant term is –4, so keep it as is.  
6. Combine the parts: **5m – 4**.

---

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Why it happens | Example |
|---------|----------------|---------|
| Writing just a number (e.g., 7, 1, 4) | Forgetting the *m* terms | “7” – you added 2m and 3m as 5, but missed the *m* |
| Writing “1m” or “m” | Thinking the sum is 1 | “1m” – you didn’t add 2m + 3m correctly |
| Writing “5m+4” or “5m – 7” | Changing the sign of the constant | The constant is –4, not +4 or –7 |
| Writing “5m-5” or “5m-4” but with wrong symbol | Typo or using a wrong dash | “5m-5” – the constant should be –4 |
| Writing “5x-4” | Mixing variables | Only *m* appears in the question |
| Writing “5m^2 – 4” | Adding an exponent | The question only has linear terms (first degree) |

---

## Keep Practicing

- **Add the *m* terms first.**  
- **Keep the constant separate** until you finish adding the variables.  
- **Double‑check your signs** (plus or minus).

You can do it! Keep practicing, and you’ll master simplifying expressions in no time.

## Question 27: Expand: 3(x – 2).
**Correct Answer:** 3x-6
**Explanation / Steps:**
## Feedback  
Good job to everyone who answered **3x – 6**!  
For the others, don’t worry—mathematics is a skill that gets better with practice.  

## Steps to Solve  
1. Look at the expression: 3(x – 2).  
2. The 3 is outside the parentheses.  
3. Multiply 3 by the first term inside: 3 × x = 3x.  
4. Multiply 3 by the second term inside: 3 × (–2) = –6.  
5. Combine the two results: **3x – 6**.  

## Common Mistakes  
- **Missing the minus sign**: 3x6 (you forgot “–6”).  
- **Not multiplying the –2**: 3x – 2 (you only wrote 3x).  
- **Wrong sign**: 3x + 6 (you added instead of subtracted).  
- **Leaving the parentheses**: 3(x – 2) (you didn’t expand).  
- **Writing a number instead of 3x**: 15 – 2, 9, 18, 5, 6, 11, etc. (you lost the 3x part).  

## Keep Practicing  
Try another example: Expand 4(y + 3).  
Remember: multiply the number outside by each term inside the parentheses.  
You can do it! Keep trying and you’ll master it quickly.

## Question 28: Factorise: 9x² + 6x.
**Correct Answer:** 3x(3x+2)
**Explanation / Steps:**
## Feedback  
Good job on trying to factor the expression!  
The correct factorisation is  

**3x(3x + 2)**  

You can see this in many of the student responses that show the correct form.

## Steps to Solve  
1. Look at the expression: **9x² + 6x**.  
2. Find the **greatest common factor (GCF)** of the two terms.  
   * 9x² and 6x both contain **x** and a number that divides both 9 and 6.  
   * The biggest number that divides 9 and 6 is **3**.  
3. Take out the GCF:  
   * 9x² ÷ 3x = **3x**  
   * 6x ÷ 3x = **2**  
4. Write the expression as the GCF times what’s left:  
   **3x (3x + 2)**

## Common Mistakes  
| Mistake | Example | Why it is wrong |
|---------|---------|-----------------|
| Forgetting the **x** in the GCF | `3(3x + 2)` | 9x² and 6x both have an **x**, so it must stay in the factor. |
| Mixing up the signs | `3x(3x – 2)` | The original has +6x, not –6x. |
| Writing the factor as a product of numbers only | `9x² + 6x = 3x(3x + 2)` | This is correct, but some wrote `3x3x^2+3x2x` which mixes terms incorrectly. |
| Writing a single number instead of a factor | `6` or `24x` | These are not factored forms; they miss the GCF and the parentheses. |

## Keep Practicing  
Factorising is like finding the building blocks of a math problem. Keep looking for the biggest common factor in each pair of terms. Try a few more examples, and you will get even better! You can do it!

## Question 29: Form an expression for the perimeter of a triangle with sides x, x + 2, and 2x – 1.
**Correct Answer:** 4x+1
**Explanation / Steps:**
## Feedback  
Good job!  
You can write the perimeter of a triangle by adding all three sides together.  
The answer is **4x + 1**.

## Steps to Solve  
1. **Write each side**:  
   - Side 1 = `x`  
   - Side 2 = `x + 2`  
   - Side 3 = `2x – 1`
2. **Add them together**:  
   `x + (x + 2) + (2x – 1)`
3. **Combine like terms**:  
   - `x + x = 2x`  
   - `2x + 2x = 4x`  
   - `2 + (–1) = 1`
4. **Result**: `4x + 1`

## Common Mistakes  
| Mistake | Example | Why it is wrong |
|---------|---------|-----------------|
| Forgetting a sign | `4x – 1` | The `–1` should be added, not subtracted. |
| Missing a side | `4x + 1` only after adding two sides | All three sides must be used. |
| Wrong parentheses | `(x³+2)(2-1)` | That is multiplication, not addition. |
| Writing only a number | `1` | The perimeter depends on `x`; it is not a fixed number. |
| Wrong order of operations | `2×` | Use addition, not multiplication, for perimeter. |

### Example of a correct answer  
```text
Perimeter = x + (x + 2) + (2x – 1) = 4x + 1
```

## Keep Practicing  
You did great with many correct answers! Keep adding the sides step by step, and check your signs. You can do it!

## Question 30: Substitute p = –1, q = 3 into 2p + q².
**Correct Answer:** 7
**Explanation / Steps:**
## Feedback  
Good job to everyone who got the right answer **7**!  
You did well by putting in the numbers and doing the math.  
If you made a mistake, don’t worry – it’s normal. Let’s see how to get the right answer step by step.

## Steps to Solve  
1. **Write the expression**: \(2p + q^{2}\).  
2. **Substitute the values**: \(p = -1\) and \(q = 3\).  
   \[
   2(-1) + 3^{2}
   \]
3. **Calculate each part**:  
   * \(2(-1) = -2\)  
   * \(3^{2} = 9\)  
4. **Add them together**: \(-2 + 9 = 7\).  
5. The final answer is **7**.

## Common Mistakes  
| Mistake | Why it happens | Fix |
|---------|----------------|-----|
| Writing **26** | Adding 2 and 6, or doing \(2(-1)+3^2 = -2+9 = 7\) but then writing 26 by mistake. | Double‑check the calculation of \(-2+9\). |
| Writing **11** or **-4** | Forgetting to square 3 (so they used \(q\) instead of \(q^2\)), or mis‑adding the signs. | Remember \(q^2 = 3^2 = 9\). |
| Writing **8** or **10** | Adding 2 and 6, or mis‑computing \(-2+9\). | Re‑do the addition: \(-2 + 9 = 7\). |
| Writing **q** or “Me” | Not knowing what to write or typing randomly. | Write the full expression and the final number. |
| Writing “2p = 2(-1) = -2” only | Stopping before adding \(q^2\). | Don’t forget the \(+ q^2\) part. |

## Keep Practicing  
You can do it! Try another problem:  
“Substitute \(x = 4\) and \(y = -2\) into \(3x - y^{2}\).”  
Use the same steps and check your work. Good luck!
