## Question 21: Define categorical data.
**Correct Answer:** Book
**Explanation / Steps:**
## Feedback  
Good effort everyone! I can see you all tried hard to capture what categorical data is. The correct answer is: **“Data that can be grouped into categories.”**  

## Steps to Solve  
1. Recall that categorical (qualitative) data describes *qualities* rather than numbers.  
2. Think of everyday examples—eye colour, favourite food, car brand.  
3. Notice that each example can be put into a *labelled* group, not measured on a scale.  

## Common Mistakes  
- Mixing “group” with “numerical” – many wrote “data in group” but didn’t mention the *labels*.  
- Writing vague phrases like “labels” or “categories” without linking them to “data that can be grouped.”  

## Keep Practicing  
Next time, try writing the definition and then giving two clear examples. This will help solidify the idea that categorical data is about *labels* and *grouping*, not numbers. Keep it up!
