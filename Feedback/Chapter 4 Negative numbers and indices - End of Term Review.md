## Question 21: Calculate –12 + 19.
**Correct Answer:** 7
**Explanation / Steps:**
## Feedback  
Good job to everyone who answered **7**!  
Some of you got different answers. Let’s see how to do it step by step.

## Steps to Solve  
1. Write the numbers: **–12** and **+19**.  
2. Think of 19 as “12 + 7”.  
3. Add –12 + 12 = 0.  
4. Now add 0 + 7 = **7**.  
So the answer is **7**.

## Common Mistakes  
- **Mixing signs**: writing 12 instead of –12.  
- **Adding wrong numbers**: adding 19 to –12 directly can feel confusing.  
- **Subtracting instead of adding**: thinking –12 + 19 = –12 – 19.  
Example:  
  - Wrong: –12 + 19 = –31  
  - Right: –12 + 19 = 7

## Question 22: Evaluate –15 – 8.
**Correct Answer:** -23
**Explanation / Steps:**
## Feedback  
Good job!  
You have worked on the problem **–15 – 8**.  
Let’s see how to solve it correctly and why some of the other answers are wrong.

## Steps to Solve  
1. Write the problem: **–15 – 8**.  
2. Think of subtraction as adding the opposite.  
3. The opposite of 8 is –8.  
4. Add the numbers: –15 + (–8) = –15 – 8.  
5. –15 + (–8) = –23.  
6. So the answer is **–23**.

(You can also use a number line: start at –15, move 8 units to the left → –23.)

## Common Mistakes  
| Mistake | What the student did | Why it is wrong | Example | Correct way |
|---------|----------------------|-----------------|---------|-------------|
| Wrong sign | Writing 23 instead of –23 | Forgot that the result is negative | Student wrote 23 | Keep the negative sign |
| Adding instead of subtracting | Writing –7 (–15 + 8) | Subtracted 8, but the problem says subtract 8 | –15 + 8 = –7 | –15 – 8 = –23 |
| Mis‑reading the problem | Writing –27 | Counted too many units | –15 – 8 → –23 | –15 – 8 → –23 |
| Writing the wrong number | 7, 61, 158, etc. | Confused the operation or used the wrong numbers | –15 – 8 ≠ 7 | –15 – 8 = –23 |

### Quick tip  
If you write the problem as **–15 – 8 = –(15 + 8)**, the negative sign is clear and you will not forget it.

## Keep Practicing  
You can do it!  
Try a few more problems with negative numbers.  
Remember: subtracting a positive number moves left on the number line.  
Keep up the good work!

## Question 23: Find (–9) × 5.
**Correct Answer:** -45
**Explanation / Steps:**
## Feedback  
Good job!  
The answer to (–9) × 5 is **–45**.  
You did it right many times.

## Steps to Solve  
1. Look at the numbers: –9 and 5.  
2. Multiply the absolute values: 9 × 5 = 45.  
3. Check the signs.  
   * –9 is negative.

## Question 24: Find (–42) ÷ (–6).
**Correct Answer:** 7
**Explanation / Steps:**
## Feedback  
Good job to everyone who answered **7**!  
You did well because you remembered that dividing two negative numbers gives a positive number.

Some of you got a different answer (8, 57, -45, 83, 15, 4, Idk, Ok).  
That is okay. Let’s look at why those answers are not correct.

## Steps to Solve  
1. Write the problem: (–42) ÷ (–6).  
2. Look at the signs: both numbers are negative.  
3. Two negatives make a positive.  
4. Divide the absolute values: 42 ÷ 6 = 7.  
5. Add the positive sign: the answer is **+7**.

## Common Mistakes  
| Mistake | Example | Why it happens | Fix |
|---------|---------|----------------|-----|
| Using the wrong sign | 8 | Forgot that 42 ÷ 6 = 7, not 8 | Check the division 42 ÷ 6 |
| Adding numbers instead of dividing | 57 | Did 42 + 6 = 48 or 42 + 15 = 57 | Remember “÷” means divide, not add |
| Mixing up the signs | –45 | Took 42 ÷ 6 = 7 and then wrote –7, then changed to –45 | Two negatives give a positive |
| Guessing or saying “Idk” | Idk | Unsure how to solve | Review the steps above |
| Misreading the problem | 4 | Maybe read 42 ÷ 10 ≈ 4.2 → 4 | Double‑check the numbers in the problem |
| Saying “Ok” without a number | Ok | Not giving an answer | Provide the number that is asked for |

## Keep Practicing  
Try another problem: (–30) ÷ (–5).  
Follow the same steps and you will get the correct answer in no time!

## Question 25: Write the value of 8².
**Correct Answer:** 64
**Explanation / Steps:**
## Feedback  

Good job!  
Most of you answered **64** which is the right answer.  
A few of you wrote the same answer in a different way (for example “8x8” or “8 × 8 = 64”).  
That is also correct because you showed how to multiply 8 by 8.  

Some answers were not correct – 9, 16, or 72.  
That shows that you are trying, but you need to remember the rule for squaring a number.

---

## Steps to Solve  

1. **Understand “square.”**  
   “8²” means 8 × 8.  

2. **Multiply 8 by 8.**  
   8 + 8 + 8 + 8 + 8 + 8 + 8 + 8 = 64.  

3. **Write the answer.**  
   The value is **64**.  
   You can also write it as “8 × 8 = 64” – that is fine too.

---

## Common Mistakes  

| Mistake | Why it happens | Example |
|---------|----------------|---------|
| Writing a wrong number (9, 16, 72) | Mixing up multiplication or addition | 8 + 8 = 16 (addition) instead of 8 × 8 |
| Forgetting the “square” rule | Not remembering that “²” means “times itself” | Thinking 8² is 8 × 2 |
| Writing a string like “8x8” only | It is okay, but if you don't show the result, it looks incomplete | 8x8 without the =64 part |

---

## Keep Practicing  

- Try squaring different numbers: 5², 3², 9².  
- Write both the expression (5 × 5) and the result (25).  
- Check your work with a calculator if you can.  

You can do it! Keep practicing and you’ll become even faster.

## Question 26: Write the value of √49.
**Correct Answer:** 7
**Explanation / Steps:**
## Feedback  
Good job, everyone!  
Most of you wrote **7** – that is the correct answer.  
A few of you wrote **49**, **45**, **8**, or even “Regis hansom.”  
That means you didn’t finish the step of finding the square root.  

## Steps to Solve  
1. Look at the number under the root sign: 49.  
2. Find a number that multiplied by itself gives 49.  
3. 7 × 7 = 49.  
4. Therefore √49 = 7.  

## Common Mistakes  
- **Answering with 49**: Forgetting to take the root.  
  - *Example*: “The value is 49.”  
- **Answering with 8 or 45**: Guessing or using a wrong multiplication.  
- **Writing “Regis hansom” or “Idk”**: Not knowing how to find the root.  

## Keep Practicing  
Try a few more perfect squares: √25, √36, √64.  
You can do it! Keep checking your work, and you’ll get all the answers right.

## Question 27: Estimate 483 – 198 by rounding to the nearest hundred.
**Correct Answer:** 300
**Explanation / Steps:**
## Feedback  
Good job! Most of you answered **300**. That is the right answer.  

## Steps to Solve  
1. Look at the first number: **483**.  
   * The nearest hundred is **500**.  
2. Look at the second number: **198**.  
   * The nearest hundred is **200**.  
3. Subtract the rounded numbers:  
   * **500 – 200 = 300**.  

So the estimated result is **300**.  

## Common Mistakes  
- **Using the exact numbers**:  
  483 – 198 = 285.  
  285 is the exact answer, not the rounded estimate.  
- **Rounding wrong**:  
  * If you round 483 to 400 instead of 500, you get 400 – 200 = 200.  
  * If you round 198 to 100, you get 500 – 100 = 400.  
- **Adding instead of subtracting**:  
  500 + 200 = 700 (some students wrote 700).  
- **Mixing up the numbers**:  
  198 rounded to 200, 483 rounded to 500. If you switch them, you might write 200 – 500 = –300.  

## Keep Practicing  
You can do it! Keep trying to round each number first, then subtract. Great work!

## Question 28: What is the cube of 3?
**Correct Answer:** 27
**Explanation / Steps:**
## Feedback  
Good job to everyone who answered **27**!  
The cube of 3 is indeed **27**.  

## Steps to Solve  
1. Write the number 3.  
2. Multiply 3 by itself: 3 × 3 = 9.  
3. Multiply the result by 3 again: 9 × 3 = 27.  
4. So, 3³ = 27.  

## Common Mistakes  
- **Answering 3 or 4** – You forgot to multiply three times.  
- **Answering 9** – You only multiplied twice (3 × 3).  
- **Answering 81** – You multiplied more times (3 × 3 × 3 × 3).  
- **Answering -7, -8, or other numbers** – These come from mis‑reading the problem or using the wrong operation.  
- **Using “√27”** – That is the square root, not the cube.  
- **Saying “None” or “Nothing”** – Remember to give a number.

## Keep Practicing  
Try another example: what is the cube of 4?  
Remember: 4 × 4 × 4 = 64.  
Keep practicing, and you will get it every time!

## Question 29: Simplify –7 – (–10).
**Correct Answer:** 3
**Explanation / Steps:**
## Feedback  
Good job!  
The correct answer is **3**.

## Steps to Solve  
1. Write the expression: –7 – (–10).  
2. A minus in front of a parenthesis means “minus the inside value.”  
3. So it becomes –7 plus 10.  
4. –7 + 10 = 3.  

## Common Mistakes  
- **Mixing up signs**: Some students wrote –7 + 10 = –3.  
  *Remember:* minus minus becomes plus.  
- **Ignoring the parenthesis**: Writing –7 – –10 as –7 – 10 gives –17.  
  *Check the parentheses first.*  
- **Adding wrong numbers**: Writing 7 + 10 = 3 is wrong.  
  *7 is positive, not –7.*

## Keep Practicing  
Try more problems with parentheses and double negatives. You can do it!

## Question 30: Between which two integers does √50 lie?
**Correct Answer:** 7,8
**Explanation / Steps:**
## Feedback  
Good job!  
You got most of the answers right.  
The correct answer is: **Between 7 and 8**.  

## Steps to Solve  
1. Find a number that is close to 50.  
2. Check 7² and 8².  
3. 7² = 49.  
4. 8² = 64.  
5. 50 is bigger than 49 but smaller than 64.  
6. Therefore √50 is between 7 and 8.  

## Common Mistakes  
- **Saying “7 or 8”** – That means you are unsure.  
- **Writing “7,8” or “7&8”** – It looks messy.  
- **Saying “6” or “8‑9”** – Those numbers are too far away.  
- **Using “64” or “48”** – Those are the squares, not the square root.  

## Keep Practicing  
Keep checking squares like we did.  
You can do it! 🚀
