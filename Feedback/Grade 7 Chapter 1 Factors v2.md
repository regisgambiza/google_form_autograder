## Question 1: 1. A school in Bangkok has 432 students. Each van can carry 12 students. Use divisibility tests to check if all students can travel in vans without leaving anyone behind.
**Correct Answer:** 36
**Explanation / Steps:**
## Feedback  
Good job!  
The correct answer is **36 vans**.  
All 432 students can travel in 36 vans without anyone left behind.

## Steps to Solve  
1. Check if 432 can be divided by 12.  
2. To test for 12, check two rules:  
   * The number must be divisible by **3**.  
   * The number must be divisible by **4**.  
3. Add the digits: 4 + 3 + 2 = **9**.  
   * 9 is divisible by 3 → the first rule is satisfied.  
4. Look at the last two digits: 32.  
   * 32 ÷ 4 = 8 → no remainder → the second rule is satisfied.  
5. Since both rules are true, 432 is divisible by 12.  
6. Divide to find the number of vans:  
   * 432 ÷ 12 = **36**.

## Common Mistakes  
- **Answer “9” or “32”** – these are wrong because they are not the number of vans.  
- **Answer “39”** – a mis‑calculation of 432 ÷ 12.  
- **Thinking “432 ÷ 12 = 36” is enough** – you still need to show the divisibility test if the question asks for it.  
- **Missing one of the two rules for 12** – forgetting to check divisibility by 3 or by 4.

## Keep Practicing  
You can do it!  
Try another number, like 300 students with vans that hold 10 each.  
Check the divisibility rules, then divide.  
Keep up the good work!

## Question 2: 2. A fruit seller in Chiang Mai has 3,240 rambutans. She wants to pack them equally into baskets of 9. Use a divisibility test to decide if it is possible.
**Correct Answer:** 360
**Explanation / Steps:**
## Feedback  
Good job!  
You found the right answer 360.  
You used the divisibility test for 9 correctly.

## Steps to Solve  
1. **Add the digits of 3,240**:  
   3 + 2 + 4 + 0 = 9.  
2. **Check the sum**:  
   9 is a multiple of 9.  
3. **Divide**:  
   3,240 ÷ 9 = 360.  
4. **Result**:  
   360 baskets, no leftover.

## Common Mistakes  
- **Wrong digit sum**:  
  If you add wrong, you may think it is not divisible.  
  Example: 3 + 2 + 4 + 0 = 9 (correct).  
- **Wrong division**:  
  3,240 ÷ 9 = 360, not 340 or 9.  
- **Skipping the test**:  
  Some say “Possible” but don’t show the test.

## Keep Practicing  
Keep checking the sum of digits for numbers that must be divided by 9.  
You can do it!

## Question 3: 3. A farmer has 4,620 mangoes. He wants to pack them in groups of 11. Is it possible to divide them exactly?
**Correct Answer:** 420
**Explanation / Steps:**
## Feedback  
Good job!  
The farmer can pack all 4,620 mangoes exactly into groups of 11.  
The number of groups is **420**.

## Steps to Solve  
1. Take the total mangoes: 4,620.  
2. Divide by the group size: 4,620 ÷ 11.  
3. 11 × 420 = 4,620.  
4. Because there is no remainder, the division is exact.  

## Common Mistakes  
- **Mixing up groups and mangoes** – Some students said “420 groups of 11” which is wrong; it is 420 *groups* of 11 mangoes each.  
- **Wrong calculation** – Saying “No” or “It ain't divisible” happens when you do the division incorrectly.  
- **Leaving a remainder** – If you think 4,620 ÷ 11 = 420 remainder 0, that is correct. If you see a remainder, you made a mistake.

## Keep Practicing  
Try another problem: 3,300 apples into groups of 12. Is it exact? You can use the same steps. Keep practicing, and you will get better!

## Question 4: 4. The BTS Skytrain has 1,260 passengers during rush hour. Each train has 6 carriages. Use a divisibility test to see if the passengers can be divided equally among the carriages.
**Correct Answer:** 210
**Explanation / Steps:**
## Feedback  
Good job!  
You got the right answer: **210 passengers per carriage**.  
You used the correct idea of checking if 1,260 can be split evenly into 6 cars.

## Steps to Solve  
1. Write the number of passengers: **1,260**.  
2. Write the number of carriages: **6**.  
3. Divide 1,260 by 6.  
   * 6 goes into 12 two times → 2.  
   * Bring down the 6 → 6 ÷ 6 = 1.  
   * Bring down the 0 → 0 ÷ 6 = 0.  
   * Result = **210**.  
4. Since the division has no remainder, the passengers can be divided equally.  
5. Each carriage gets **210 passengers**.

## Common Mistakes  
- **Using the wrong divisor**: Some students might try to divide by 3 or 5 instead of 6.  
- **Wrong divisibility test**: Checking only the sum of digits for 3 (9) or 9 (9) is fine, but you must remember the whole number must still be divisible by 6 (both 2 and 3).  
- **Rounding instead of exact division**: Saying “about 210” is okay, but the exact answer is 210 with no remainder.  
- **Writing “210 per carriages” instead of “210 per carriage”**: The word should be singular because it describes one carriage.

## Keep Practicing  
Keep checking if a number can be split evenly. Try another example: 1,320 passengers with 5 carriages. Can you find how many passengers per carriage? You can do it!

## Question 5: 5. A noodle shop in Ayutthaya prepares 2,475 bowls of noodles for a festival. If each box holds 25 bowls, check if they can pack them evenly.
**Correct Answer:** 99
**Explanation / Steps:**
## Feedback  
Good job!  
The correct answer is **99 boxes**.

## Steps to Solve  
1. Count the bowls: 2,475.  
2. Count bowls per box: 25.  
3. Divide bowls by bowls per box:  
   \[
   2,475 \div 25 = 99
   \]  
4. Check: 25 × 99 = 2,475.  
   So there is no leftover bowl.

## Common Mistakes  
- **Wrong division**: Some wrote 107 boxes.  
  *Why?* 107 × 25 = 2,675, not 2,475.  
- **Rounding**: Thinking 2,475 ÷ 25 ≈ 100.  
  *Why not?* 25 × 100 = 2,500, which is too many bowls.  
- **Missing the remainder**: If you do the long division and see a remainder, you cannot pack evenly.

## Keep Practicing  
Try another example: If a shop has 1,200 bowls and each box holds 30 bowls, how many boxes?  
You can do the same steps: 1,200 ÷ 30 = 40.  

Keep practicing division and you will get even better!

## Question 6: 6. A monk receives 1,458 lotus flowers as donations. He wants to share them equally among 9 temples. Can he?
**Correct Answer:** 162
**Explanation / Steps:**
## Feedback  
Good job!  
The monk can share the flowers equally.  
The answer is **162** flowers for each temple.

## Steps to Solve  
1. Write the total flowers: **1458**.  
2. Write the number of temples: **9**.  
3. Divide 1458 by 9.  
   - 9 × 100 = 900  
   - 9 × 60 = 540 → 900 + 540 = 1440  
   - 9 × 2 = 18 → 1440 + 18 = 1458  
4. The result is **162**.  
   So each temple gets 162 flowers.

## Common Mistakes  
- **Using the wrong divisor**: some wrote 9 but thought of 10.  
- **Wrong multiplication**: 9 × 170 = 1530, not 1458.  
- **Skipping the check**: after dividing, always add back 9 × 162 to see if you get 1458.  
- **Misreading the answer**: writing 165 or 152 instead of 162.

## Keep Practicing  
Try another problem: divide 2,520 by 6. You can do it!

## Question 7: 7. A fisherman brings 624 fish to the market. He wants to arrange them into groups of 8. Use divisibility rules to check.
**Correct Answer:** 78
**Explanation / Steps:**
## Feedback  
Good job!  
The correct answer is **78**.  
You did it right for almost all of you. Great work!

## Steps to Solve  
1. **Check divisibility by 8**.  
   - A number is divisible by 8 if the last three digits form a number that is a multiple of 8.  
   - The last three digits of 624 are 624.  
   - 624 ÷ 8 = 78, no remainder.  
2. **Count the groups**.  
   - 624 fish ÷ 8 fish per group = 78 groups.  

## Common Mistakes  
- **Answer “8.5”** – this is what you get if you try to divide 624 by 10 instead of 8.  
- **Answer “99 boxes”** – 624 ÷ 8 = 78, not 99.  
- Forgetting to check the remainder.  
- Saying “Yes” without showing the calculation.  

## Keep Practicing  
Keep checking the last three digits for divisibility by 8.  
Try more problems with different numbers. You can do it!

## Question 8: 8. A school has 360 students in Grade 7 and 450 students in Grade 8. The principal wants to divide them into equal-sized groups with no one left out. What is the largest group size?
**Correct Answer:** 9
**Explanation / Steps:**
## Feedback  
Good job!  
You answered many of the questions correctly.  
The correct answer for the largest group size is **90** students.

## Steps to Solve  
1. **Find the numbers of students**  
   - Grade7: 360 students  
   - Grade8: 450 students  

2. **Think of “largest group size”**  
   We need a number that divides both 360 and 450 exactly, with no leftovers.  
   This is called the *greatest common divisor* (GCD).

3. **Use the GCD method**  
   - Divide the larger number by the smaller number:  
     450 ÷ 360 = 1 remainder 90.  
   - Now divide 360 by the remainder 90:  
     360 ÷ 90 = 4 remainder 0.  

   When the remainder becomes 0, the last divisor is the GCD.  
   So, GCD(360,450) = 90.

4. **Answer**  
   The largest group size that works for both grades is **90** students.

## Common Mistakes  
- **Using 400 or 405** – Some students guessed 400 or 405, maybe thinking “close to 450” or “360+450 = 810, 810 ÷ 90 = 9 groups.”  
- **Mixing up GCD with LCM** – The LCM (least common multiple) would give a larger number that *adds* groups, not the largest group size that fits both grades.  
- **Adding the two class sizes** – 360 + 450 = 810, but that total does not help find the group size.  
- **Writing the answer in a sentence** – That is fine, but make sure the number itself is clear (e.g., “90”).

## Keep Practicing  
You’re on the right track!  
Try more GCD problems with different numbers.  
Keep using the “divide, remainder, repeat” trick.  
You can do it!

## Question 9: 9. Two bus routes in Chiang Rai: one arrives every 15 minutes, another every 20 minutes. If they both start at 7:00 a.m., when will they next arrive together?
**Correct Answer:** 60
**Explanation / Steps:**
## Feedback  
Good job!  
You answered the question correctly. All of your responses say that the buses will next arrive together at **8:00a.m.** Great work!

## Steps to Solve  
1. **Find the intervals** – One bus comes every 15 minutes, the other every 20 minutes.  
2. **Look for a time that is a multiple of both 15 and 20.**  
3. **Use the Least Common Multiple (LCM).**  
   - Multiples of 15: 15, 30, 45, 60, 75…  
   - Multiples of 20: 20, 40, 60, 80…  
4. **The first common multiple is 60 minutes.**  
5. **Add 60 minutes to the start time of 7:00a.m.**  
6. **Result:** 7:00a.m. + 1 hour = 8:00a.m.

## Common Mistakes  
- **Wrong LCM** – Some students think the LCM is 30 or 20.  
- **Adding wrong time** – Forgetting to add 60 minutes, or adding 15 or 20 minutes instead.  
- **Mixing up “next” and “first”** – The next time after 7:00a.m. is 8:00a.m., not 7:15 or 7:20.

## Keep Practicing  
You can do it! Try another problem: If a bus comes every 12 minutes and another every 18 minutes, when will they both arrive together after 7:00a.m.? Good luck!

## Question 10: 10. A temple bell rings every 12 minutes, while a drum is beaten every 18 minutes. If both started at 6:00 a.m., when will they sound together again?
**Correct Answer:** 6:36
**Explanation / Steps:**
## Feedback  
Good job!  
You answered the question correctly. All the correct answers say the bell and drum will sound together again at **6:36a.m.**  

## Steps to Solve  
1. Find the **common time** when both happen.  
2. The bell rings every **12 minutes**.  
3. The drum rings every **18 minutes**.  
4. The next time they both ring together is the **least common multiple (LCM)** of 12 and 18.  
5. 12 = 2 × 2 × 3  
6. 18 = 2 × 3 × 3  
7. Take the highest power of each prime: 2² × 3² = 4 × 9 = **36 minutes**.  
8. Add 36 minutes to the start time 6:00a.m. → 6:36a.m.  

## Common Mistakes  
- **Answering 6:30a.m.** – This happens if you add 30 minutes instead of the correct 36 minutes.  
- **Wrong format** – “6.36am” or “6 36 am” can be confusing. Use the colon and “a.m.”, e.g., 6:36a.m.  
- Forgetting to find the LCM – Just adding the two times together does not give the correct answer.  

## Keep Practicing  
Keep using the LCM idea for similar problems. You can do it! Keep up the good work!

## Question 11: 11. A teacher brings 96 pencils and 144 erasers. She wants to give identical sets to her students without leftovers. What is the greatest number of students?
**Correct Answer:** 48
**Explanation / Steps:**
## Feedback  
Good job!  
You answered **48** which is the right number of students.

---

## Steps to Solve  
1. **Find the greatest common divisor (GCD)** of the two numbers.  
   * 96 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 3  
   * 144 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 3 × 3  
2. The GCD is the product of the smallest power of each common factor.  
   * Common factors: 2 and 3  
   * Smallest powers: 2⁴ (from 96) and 3¹  
   * GCD = 2⁴ × 3¹ = 16 × 3 = **48**  
3. The teacher can give the items to **48** students.  
   * Each student gets 96 ÷ 48 = **2 pencils**  
   * Each student gets 144 ÷ 48 = **3 erasers**

---

## Common Mistakes  
| Mistake | Why it happens | Fix |
|---------|----------------|-----|
| **Answer 12 students** | Thinking the division 96 ÷ 12 = 8 and 144 ÷ 12 = 12 gives “equal sets” | The sets must have the *same* number of pencils *and* erasers for each student. 12 students gives 8 pencils and 12 erasers, not identical sets. |
| **Answer 120 students** | Confusing “maximum number of students” with “minimum number of students” | We want the *greatest* number of students that still divides both 96 and 144. 120 does not divide 96. |
| **Using only one factor (e.g., 6 pencils, 6 erasers)** | Forgetting to check both items at the same time | Check that the number divides *both* totals, not just one. |

## Question 12: 12. A market vendor sells 120 pineapples and 180 bananas. She wants to pack fruit bags with the same mix. What is the greatest number of bags she can make?
**Correct Answer:** 60
**Explanation / Steps:**
## Feedback  
Good job to everyone who answered **60**!  
You found the right number of bags.  
For the ones who answered something else, let’s see how to get the correct answer.

## Steps to Solve  
1. **Count the fruits.**  
   - Pineapples = 120  
   - Bananas = 180  

2. **Find the biggest number that divides both 120 and 180.**  
   - This is called the *greatest common divisor* (GCD).  
   - Try dividing 120 by small numbers:  
     - 120 ÷ 2 = 60  
     - 120 ÷ 3 = 40  
     - 120 ÷ 4 = 30  
     - …  
   - Do the same for 180.  
   - The largest number that works for both is **60**.  

3. **Each bag will have**  
   - 120 ÷ 60 = 2 pineapples  
   - 180 ÷ 60 = 3 bananas  

So the vendor can make **60 bags**.

## Common Mistakes  
- **Using the wrong divisor** – e.g., thinking 40 is the GCD because 120 ÷ 40 = 3 and 180 ÷ 40 = 4.5 (not a whole number).  
- **Mixing up the two numbers** – dividing 180 by 60 gives 3 bananas, but dividing 120 by 60 gives 2 pineapples.  
- **Adding extra numbers** – writing “150” or “40” instead of 60.  
- **Forgetting the GCD** – just picking any number that divides one of the totals but not the other.

## Keep Practicing  
Great work! Keep looking for the biggest number that divides all the fruits. You can try another problem:  
*If a vendor has 84 apples and 126 oranges, how many equal‑mix bags can she make?*  
You’ll get it! Keep practicing, and you’ll become a pro at this.

## Question 13: 13. A concert in Bangkok has fireworks every 24 minutes and laser shows every 40 minutes. If both start at 7:00 p.m., when will they happen together?
**Correct Answer:** 9
**Explanation / Steps:**
## Feedback  
Good job!  
You answered the question about the fireworks and laser shows.  
The right answer is **9:00p.m.**  

## Steps to Solve  
1. Find how many minutes the two events need to line up again.  
2. The fireworks come every 24minutes.  
3. The lasers come every 40minutes.  
4. The first time both happen together again is the **LCM** (lowest common multiple) of 24 and 40.  
5. 24 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 3  
6. 40 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 5  
7. Take the highest power of each prime: 2³ × 3 × 5 = 8 × 3 × 5 = **120** minutes.  
8. 120 minutes = 2 hours.  
9. Both start at 7:00p.m. Add 2 hours → **9:00p.m.**  

## Common Mistakes  
- **Answering 8:00p.m.** – This is 1 hour after 7:00p.m. but the LCM is 2 hours, not 1.  
- **Answering 9p.m. or 9:00p.m.** – Correct, but be careful to write it with a colon and “p.m.”  
- **Answering 120 or 120 minutes** – That is the *time interval*, not the clock time.  
- **Answering 8:40p.m.** – 8:40 is 40 minutes after 8:00, but the next coincidence is 2 hours later, not 1 hour 40 minutes.  

## Keep Practicing  
You can do it! Try another problem with different numbers (e.g., 15 and 30 minutes) and find the next time they match. Keep up the good work!

## Question 14: 14. Two ferries leave Phuket pier: one every 30 minutes, the other every 45 minutes. If both leave at 6:00 a.m., what time will they both leave together again?
**Correct Answer:** 90
**Explanation / Steps:**
## Feedback  
Good job!  
You have many good answers. The correct time is **7:30a.m.** Some of you wrote this exactly. That is great!

## Steps to Solve  
1. The first ferry leaves every 30 minutes.  
2. The second ferry leaves every 45 minutes.  
3. Find a time that is a multiple of both 30 and 45.  
4. The smallest number that works for both is 90 minutes.  
5. 90 minutes after 6:00a.m. is 7:30a.m.  
So the next time they both leave together is **7:30a.m.**

## Common Mistakes  
- **Answer “67”** – you might have added 30 and 45 incorrectly.  
- **Answer “90”** – that is the number of minutes, not the clock time.  
- **Answer “7a.m.” or “7:00a.m.”** – you skipped the 30‑minute interval, so you only counted the first ferry.  
- **Missing the “a.m.”** – it is good practice to write the time clearly, e.g., “7:30a.m.”  

### Example  
If you write “7:30”, that is correct, but adding “a.m.” shows the full time.

## Keep Practicing  
You are doing very well! Keep checking each step, and you will get it every time. You can do it!

## Question 15: 15. A shop has 180 bags of rice and 210 bags of sugar. He wants to create sets for donation with equal numbers of rice and sugar in each. What is the largest number of sets?
**Correct Answer:** 30
**Explanation / Steps:**
## Feedback  
Good job!  
The largest number of sets you can make is **30**.  

## Steps to Solve  
1. Write down the two numbers: 180 bags of rice and 210 bags of sugar.  
2. Find the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD).  
   * 180 ÷ 30 = 6  
   * 210 ÷ 30 = 7  
3. 30 is the biggest number that divides both 180 and 210 evenly.  
4. So you can make 30 sets, each set with 6 rice bags and 7 sugar bags.

## Common Mistakes  
- **Answering 39 or 67** – These numbers do not divide both 180 and 210 evenly.  
- **Answering 7** – 7 divides 210 but not 180.  
- **Thinking the answer is 180** – 180 divides 180, but it does not divide 210.  

Remember: the set count must use the same number of rice and sugar bags in every set.

## Keep Practicing  
Try another pair of numbers, like 96 and 72. Find the GCD and the number of sets. You can do it!

## Question 16: 16. A lantern festival has 400 small lanterns and 600 large lanterns. Organisers want to hang them in rows with equal numbers of each type. What is the largest number of rows?
**Correct Answer:** 200
**Explanation / Steps:**
## Feedback  
Good job!  
The biggest number of rows you can make is **200**.  
Some of you wrote 200 – that is right.  
A few wrote 67, 55 or even 240,000 – those are not correct.

## Steps to Solve  
1. Count the lanterns.  
   - Small lanterns = 400  
   - Large lanterns = 600  

2. Find the largest number that divides both 400 and 600.  
   - 400 ÷ 200 = 2  
   - 600 ÷ 200 = 3  

3. That number is the maximum rows.  
   - 200 rows, each with 2 small and 3 large lanterns.

## Common Mistakes  
- **Not using the greatest common divisor (GCD).**  
  Example: thinking 400 ÷ 4 = 100 rows and 600 ÷ 4 = 150 rows – 100 and 150 are not the same number of rows.  

- **Mixing up rows and lanterns.**  
  Example: writing “200 rows of 200 lanterns” – there are only 400 + 600 = 1,000 lanterns, not 200×200.  

- **Doing a random division.**  
  Example: dividing 400 by 67 gives 5.97, which does not give whole rows.  

## Keep Practicing  
Try another problem:  
“There are 360 small balloons and 480 large balloons. What is the largest number of equal rows you can make?”  
Use the same steps: find the GCD, divide, and check.  
You can do it! Keep practicing and you’ll get even better.

## Question 17: 17. A music teacher has two drum patterns. One repeats every 8 beats, the other every 12 beats. After how many beats will both patterns match again?
**Correct Answer:** 24
**Explanation / Steps:**
## Feedback  
Good job to everyone who answered **24**!  
You used the right idea: find when the two patterns line up again.

A few students wrote other numbers or made small mistakes.  
Let’s see how to solve it step‑by‑step and why 24 is the answer.

## Steps to Solve  
1. **List the beat numbers for each pattern**  
   * Pattern A repeats every 8 beats: 8, 16, 24, 32 …  
   * Pattern B repeats every 12 beats: 12, 24, 36 …  

2. **Look for the first number that appears in both lists**  
   * The first common number is **24**.  

3. **That number is the LCM (least common multiple)** of 8 and 12.  
   * LCM(8, 12) = 24.

So, both patterns match again after **24 beats**.

## Common Mistakes  
- **Using the greatest common divisor (GCD)** instead of the LCM.  
  * Example: GCD(8,12) = 4, but 4 beats is not enough to finish both patterns.  
- **Adding the numbers** instead of finding a common multiple.  
  * 8 + 12 = 20 → wrong.  
- **Ignoring the repetition** and checking only the first beat.  
  * 8 beats → Pattern B is not finished yet.  

Remember: you want the smallest number that is a multiple of *both* 8 and 12.

## Keep Practicing  
You are on the right track! Keep looking for the first common beat, and soon you will find the LCM without hesitation. Keep up the good work!

## Question 18: 18. A farmer plants coconut trees in rows of 84 trees and palm trees in rows of 126 trees. He wants to group them into plots with equal trees. What is the largest number of trees per plot?
**Correct Answer:** 42
**Explanation / Steps:**
## Feedback  
Good job to everyone!  
The answer is **42 trees per plot**.

## Steps to Solve  
1. Find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 84 and 126.  
2. 84 = 2 × 2 × 3 × 7  
3. 126 = 2 × 3 × 3 × 7  
4. Keep the common factors: 2 × 3 × 7 = 42.  
5. So the largest plot can have **42 trees**.

## Common Mistakes  
- **Thinking 24 or 67 is correct** – 24 is a divisor of 84 but not of 126.  
- **Answering “7 trees”** – 7 is a factor of both, but it is not the largest.  
- **Using the wrong method** – Some people try to add the numbers instead of finding the GCD.  
- **Misreading the question** – The farmer wants *equal* trees in each plot, so we need the largest common factor.

## Keep Practicing  
Keep looking for the largest common factor next time. You can use the prime‑factor method or a simple division check.  
You can do it! Keep up the good work.

## Question 19: 19. A school arranges 240 chairs and 360 tables in the hall. They want equal groups with the same number of chairs and tables. What is the maximum group size?
**Correct Answer:** 120
**Explanation / Steps:**
## Feedback  
Good job!  
You can make many equal groups from the chairs and tables.  
The answer is **120**.

## Steps to Solve  
1. Look at the two numbers: 240 chairs and 360 tables.  
2. Find the biggest number that divides both 240 and 360.  
   * 240 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 3 × 5  
   * 360 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 3 × 3 × 5  
3. Take the common factors with the lowest powers:  
   * 2³ (that is 8)  
   * 3¹ (that is 3)  
   * 5¹ (that is 5)  
4. Multiply them: 8 × 3 × 5 = **120**.  
5. So you can make 120 groups, each with the same number of chairs and tables.

## Common Mistakes  
- **Thinking the answer is 3, 7, 60, or 82** – these are not numbers that divide both 240 and 360.  
- **Using the LCM (largest common multiple)** – that gives the smallest number that contains all chairs and tables, not the maximum group size.  
- **Putting all chairs in one group and all tables in another** – that would not keep the groups equal.  

## Keep Practicing  
Try another pair of numbers, like 48 and 72.  
Find the biggest number that fits into both.  
You can do it!
