## Question 12: A rice trader delivers 152.45 kg of rice to one shop and 248.75 kg to another. Find the total, then round to the nearest kg.
**Correct Answer:** 401
**Explanation / Steps:**
## Feedback  
Good job!  
You did a lot of the work right. The correct answer is **401 kg**.  

## Steps to Solve  
1. Write the two amounts: 152.45 kg and 248.75 kg.  
2. Add the numbers:  
   152.45  
+ 248.75  
= 401.20  
3. Round to the nearest whole kilogram.  
   401.20 is closer to 401 than to 402, so round down.  
   Result = **401 kg**.  

## Common Mistakes  
- **Skipping the decimal part**: Some answers say 400 kg or 410 kg because the decimal was ignored.  
- **Wrong rounding**: If the decimal is 0.5 or more, round up. If it is less than 0.5, round down.  
- **Adding wrong numbers**: Always add the exact numbers, not rounded ones first.  

Example of a wrong step:  
152.45 + 248.75 → 401 (wrong, because you dropped .20).  

Correct: 152.45 + 248.75 = 401.20 → 401 after rounding.  

## Keep Practicing  
Keep adding numbers carefully and remember the rounding rule. You can do it!

## Question 13: A mobile phone costs 8,999.75 baht. Round the price to the nearest hundred, then to the nearest thousand.
**Correct Answer:** 9000
**Explanation / Steps:**
## Feedback  
Good job!  
You answered “9,000 baht” and it is correct.  

## Steps to Solve  
1. Look at the number **8,999.75**.  
2. To round to the nearest **hundred** look at the **tens** digit (the second 9).  
   - 9 is more than 5, so round up.  
   - 8,999 → **9,000**.  
3. Now round **9,000** to the nearest **thousand**.  
   - Look at the hundreds digit (0).  
   - 0 is less than 5, so keep the same.  
   - Result: **9,000** baht.  

## Common Mistakes  
- **Missing the decimal**: Some people ignore the .75 and only look at 8,999.  
- **Wrong rounding rule**: If the digit you look at is 5 or more, round up; if it is 4 or less, round down.  
- **Switching hundred and thousand**: Remember first round to hundreds, then to thousands.  
- **Writing 90,000**: That would be a mistake; 90,000 baht is ten times too high.  

## Keep Practicing  
Keep checking the digit you look at when you round. You can do it!

## Question 14: A student spends 45.75 baht on breakfast, 62.35 baht on lunch, and 38.45 baht on dinner. Find the total cost of food for the day.
**Correct Answer:** 146.55
**Explanation / Steps:**
## Feedback  
Good job!  
Most of you answered the question correctly.  
Only one of you wrote **156.55 baht** instead of **146.55 baht**.

## Steps to Solve  
1. Write the three numbers one below the other.  
   ```
   45.75
   62.35
   38.45
   ```  
2. Add the numbers in the cents column (the two digits right of the decimal).  
   75 + 35 + 45 = 155.  
   Write **55** below the line and carry **1** to the next column.  
3. Add the numbers in the dollars column plus the carry.  
   45 + 62 + 38 + 1 = 146.  
4. Combine the two parts: **146.55**.  

So the total cost of food for the day is **146.55 baht**.

## Common Mistakes  
- **Mis‑reading a number**:  
  If you read 38.45 as 48.45, the sum becomes 156.55.  
- **Skipping a carry**:  
  Forgetting to add the 1 carried from the cents column will give 145.55.  
- **Misaligning decimals**:  
  If the decimal points are not lined up, the sum will be wrong.

Example of the mistake:  
```
45.75
62.35
48.45   ← (wrong number)
_______
156.55  ← (incorrect)
```

## Keep Practicing  
You are doing great! Keep adding numbers with decimals, and remember to line up the decimal points and carry the correct amounts. You can do it!

## Question 15: A shopkeeper buys 48 bottles of juice at 12.75 baht each. What is the total cost?
**Correct Answer:** 612
**Explanation / Steps:**
## Feedback  
Good job! You are on the right track.

The answer should be **612 baht**.  

## Steps to Solve  
1. Count the bottles: 48 bottles.  
2. Find the price of one bottle: 12.75 baht.  
3. Multiply 48 by 12.75.  
   - 48 × 12 = 576  
   - 48 × 0.75 = 36  
   - Add them: 576 + 36 = 612  
4. So the total cost is **612 baht**.

## Common Mistakes  
- **Mixing up numbers**: Some of you wrote 60.75 or 609.90.  
  - 60.75 is the price of **one** bottle, not the total.  
  - 609.90 would be the result if the price were 12.75 but the quantity were 47.6, which is not the case.  
- **Missing the multiplication step**: Just writing the price of one bottle does not give the total.

## Keep Practicing  
Try another example:  
If a shopkeeper buys 25 pens at 4.20 baht each, what is the total cost?  

Remember: **total = quantity × price per item**. You can do it!

## Question 16: A bus travels 15.35 km each trip. After 52 trips, how far has it gone?
**Correct Answer:** 798.2
**Explanation / Steps:**
## Feedback  
Good job!  
Your answer should be **798.20 km**.  
Many of you got it right, but a few made small mistakes.

## Steps to Solve  
1. The bus travels **15.35 km** each trip.  
2. It makes **52 trips**.  
3. Multiply the distance per trip by the number of trips:  
   \(15.35 \times 52\).  
4. 15.35 × 52 = 798.20.  
5. So the bus goes **798.20 km**.

## Common Mistakes  
- **Missing a zero**: writing 798.2 instead of 798.20.  
- **Wrong multiplication**: using 15.3 instead of 15.35.  
- **Adding instead of multiplying**: 15.35 + 52 = 67.35 (wrong).  
- **Typing errors**: 789.20 or 797.2 are close but not correct.

## Keep Practicing  
You can do it! Keep trying multiplication problems and check your work carefully. Happy learning!

## Question 17: A family’s water bill is 325.65 baht. Round to the nearest 10 baht.
**Correct Answer:** 330
**Explanation / Steps:**
## Feedback
Good job!  
Most of you answered **330 baht** – that is the right answer.  
A few of you wrote numbers that are not the nearest 10 baht (e.g., 326, 300, 302.6).  
Let’s see how to find the nearest 10 baht correctly.

## Steps to Solve
1. Look at the **ones digit** of the number 325.65.  
2. The ones digit is **5**.  
3. When the ones digit is 5 or more, round the number **up** to the next 10.  
4. 325 rounded up to the nearest 10 is **330**.  
5. Ignore the decimal part (0.65) because we are rounding to the nearest 10 baht.

## Common Mistakes
- **Not looking at the ones digit**: Some wrote 326 because they added 1 to the whole number instead of rounding to the nearest 10.  
- **Rounding to the nearest 100 or 1 baht**: 300 or 302.6 shows confusion about rounding to 10 baht.  
- **Adding a large number**: 14,400 baht is far too high; it shows mixing up the question or misreading the bill amount.

## Keep Practicing
Keep checking the ones digit when you round to 10 baht.  
You can do it! Try another number: 482.3 – what is it rounded to the nearest 10?

## Question 18: A worker earns 475.85 baht each day. Estimate his monthly pay by rounding to the nearest 10 baht, then multiplying by 30 days.
**Correct Answer:** 14400
**Explanation / Steps:**
## Feedback  
Good job on trying to solve the problem!  
The right answer is **14,400baht**.

## Steps to Solve  
1. Look at the daily pay: 475.85baht.  
2. Round it to the nearest 10baht.  
   - 475.85 is close to 480.  
   - So the rounded daily pay is **480baht**.  
3. Multiply the rounded daily pay by 30 days.  
   - 480×30 = **14,400baht**.  

## Common Mistakes  
- **Not rounding**: If you use 475.85 instead of 480, you will get a different number.  
- **Rounding wrong way**: 475.85 could be rounded to 470 if you forget that the 8 makes it go up.  
- **Missing the “baht” unit**: Writing only numbers can be confusing.  
- **Math slip**: 480×30 is 14,400, not 14,280 or 15,000.

## Keep Practicing  
Keep working on rounding problems. You can do it!

## Question 19: A farmer sells 18.45 kg of durian at 78.5 baht/kg. What is his income?
**Correct Answer:** 1448.325
**Explanation / Steps:**
## Feedback  
Good job to everyone who worked on this problem!  
The farmer’s income is **1,448.325 baht**.  

## Steps to Solve  
1. Write the weight: 18.45 kg.  
2. Write the price: 78.5 baht per kg.  
3. Multiply the two numbers:  
   * 18.45 × 78.5  
4. Do the multiplication in parts if you want:  
   * 18 × 78.5 = 1,413  
   * 0.45 × 78.5 = 35.325  
   * Add them: 1,413 + 35.325 = **1,448.325**  
5. Add the unit: 1,448.325 baht.

## Common Mistakes  
| Mistake | Why it happens | Example |
|---------|----------------|---------|
| Forgetting the unit “baht” | Students sometimes write only the number | “1448.33” instead of “1448.33 baht” |
| Rounding too early | Rounding 78.5 to 80 changes the answer | 18.45 × 80 = 1,476 (wrong) |
| Wrong decimal point | Writing 1448.33 instead of 1448.325 | Misses the 0.325 part |
| Adding numbers instead of multiplying | Mixing up the steps | 18.45 + 78.5 = 97.0 (not income) |
| Wrong multiplication of decimal part | 0.45 × 78.5 = 35.325, not 35.25 | Leads to 1,448.25 instead of 1,448.325 |

## Question 20: A school has 356 students. Each exam paper costs 0.85 baht to print. Find the total printing cost.
**Correct Answer:** 302.6
**Explanation / Steps:**
## Feedback  
Good job!  
You did well with many of the answers.  
The correct total printing cost is **302.6 baht**.

## Steps to Solve  
1. Count the students: 356.  
2. Cost for one paper: 0.85 baht.  
3. Multiply 356 × 0.85.  
4. 356 × 0.85 = 302.6.  
5. So the total cost is 302.6 baht.

## Common Mistakes  
- **Missing the multiplication** – some wrote the cost for one paper only.  
- **Wrong decimal place** – writing 302.60 is okay, but 302.60 baht is fine too.  
- **Adding instead of multiplying** – 356 + 0.85 would be wrong.  
- **Mixing units** – “25.5 km” is a distance, not money.  
- **Wrong number** – 6366 or 3045 came from mis‑reading the problem.

## Keep Practicing  
Keep checking that you multiply the number of students by the cost per paper.  
You can do it!

## Question 21: A tuk-tuk travels 7.25 km to the market, 5.8 km to school, and 12.45 km home. Find the total distance.
**Correct Answer:** 25.5
**Explanation / Steps:**
## Feedback  
Good job! Most of you answered **25.5 km** correctly. You have done a great job adding the distances.  
If you got a different number, let’s see where it happened.

## Steps to Solve  
1. Write down each distance:  
   - Market: 7.25 km  
   - School: 5.80 km (add a 0 so the decimals line up)  
   - Home: 12.45 km  
2. Add the numbers from left to right.  
   - 7.25 + 5.80 = 13.05  
   - 13.05 + 12.45 = 25.50  
3. The total distance is **25.5 km** (you can write 25.50 if you want two decimal places).

## Common Mistakes  
| Wrong answer | Why it is wrong | Fix |
|--------------|----------------|-----|
| **13.5** | Maybe only added two distances or used wrong numbers. | Add all three numbers. |
| **25.60** | Added the 5.80 and 12.45 wrong. | 5.80 + 12.45 = 18.25, not 18.30. |
| **2844** or **3045** | Mixed up the digits or forgot the decimal point. | Keep the decimal point in place. |
| **25.5km** | Missing a space before the unit. | Write as “25.5 km”. |

## Keep Practicing  
Keep trying the same steps. If you write the numbers clearly and line up the decimals, you’ll get the right answer every time. You can do it!

## Question 22: A market bill is 248.75 baht. Round to 2 decimal places, then to the nearest 10.
**Correct Answer:** 250
**Explanation / Steps:**
## Feedback  
Good job!  
You did many correct answers.  
The right answer is **250 baht**.

---

## Steps to Solve  
1. **Round to 2 decimal places**  
   The number is 248.75.  
   It already has two decimal places, so it stays **248.75**.

2. **Round to the nearest 10**  
   Look at the tens digit: 20 (hundreds) + 80 (tens).  
   The next digit is 8 (the ones place).  
   Because 8 is 5 or more, we round up the tens digit.  
   248.75 → 250.  

So the final answer is **250 baht**.

---

## Common Mistakes  
- **Skipping the first rounding step** – some students wrote 248.75 directly as the final answer.  
- **Rounding to the nearest 10 incorrectly** – treating 8 as “less than 10” and writing 200.  
- **Adding extra words or numbers** – e.g., “248.75 and 370” or “Usid”.  
- **Writing the answer without “baht”** – the unit is needed.

## Question 23: A farmer harvested 124.35 kg of rice in the morning and 248.65 kg in the afternoon. How much rice in total, and what is the rounded weight to the nearest 10?
**Correct Answer:** 373 and 370
**Explanation / Steps:**
## Feedback  
Good job to everyone who tried!  
The correct answer is **373 kg total** and the rounded weight is **370 kg**.  
Some of you wrote only one of the two numbers, or gave a different value. Let’s see how we get the answer and why the others are not quite right.

## Steps to Solve  
1. **Add the two amounts**  
   124.35 kg + 248.65 kg = 373.00 kg  
2. **Round to the nearest 10**  
   373 kg is closer to 370 than to 380.  
   So, rounded weight = **370 kg**.

## Common Mistakes  
| Mistake | Example | Why it’s wrong |
|---------|---------|----------------|
| Only giving one number | “370” or “373” | Both the total and the rounded number are needed. |
| Adding wrong | “250” | Missed adding the two amounts. |
| Rounding wrong | “375” | 373 rounds to 370, not 380. |
| Writing extra words | “Yfudy”, “Idk” | Not a math answer. |

## Keep Practicing  
Keep adding numbers and remember to round to the nearest 10. You can do it!

## Question 24: A student divides 365.4 by 0.12. What is the result?
**Correct Answer:** 3045
**Explanation / Steps:**
## Feedback  
Good job!  
You got the answer right. The result of dividing 365.4 by 0.12 is **3,045** (or 3045).

## Steps to Solve  
1. Write the division: 365.4 ÷ 0.12.  
2. Move the decimal in the divisor (0.12) so it becomes a whole number.  
   * Multiply both the dividend and divisor by 100.  
   * 365.4 × 100 = 36,540  
   * 0.12 × 100 = 12  
3. Now divide 36,540 ÷ 12.  
4. 12 goes into 36,540 exactly 3,045 times.  
5. So the answer is 3,045.

## Common Mistakes  
- **Using a comma wrong:** Writing 3.045 (with a dot) looks like a decimal, not a whole number.  
- **Ignoring the decimal shift:** Forgetting to multiply by 100 can give a wrong answer.  
- **Wrong division:** 12 into 36,540 can be done wrong if you skip the step of moving the decimal.

## Keep Practicing  
You did great! Keep practicing division with decimals. You can do it!

4. **Write the answer.**  
   - Include the word “baht” and use a comma to separate thousands (optional but clear).

## Common Mistakes  
| Mistake | Example | Why it’s wrong | Fix |
|---------|---------|----------------|-----|
| Forgetting the word *baht* | “11493.75” | The answer is missing the currency. | Add “baht” after the number. |
| Wrong number | “18,488.75” | Mis‑multiplication or a typo. | Re‑check the multiplication or use a calculator. |
| Extra letters | “Gdgdg” | Not a number at all. | Write the number correctly. |

**Correct Answer:** 2200
**Explanation / Steps:**
## Feedback  
Good job to everyone who answered!  
The correct answer is **2,200 baht**.  
You only need to add the two amounts and then round to the nearest hundred.

## Steps to Solve  
1. **Add the two amounts**  
   \[
   1,245.75 + 987.65 = 2,233.40
   \]  
2. **Round to the nearest hundred**  
   * Look at the tens digit (3).  
   * Since 3 is less than 5, round down.  
   * 2,233.40 → **2,200**.

## Common Mistakes  
| Mistake | Example | How to fix |
|---------|---------|------------|
| Adding wrong | 1,245.75 + 987.65 = 2,200 (missing the .40) | Always keep the decimal places when adding. |
| Rounding wrong | 2,233.40 → 2,300 | Remember: if the tens digit is 5 or more, round up. |
| Wrong format | “2233.4” or “2,200baht” | Write the answer as a whole number in baht. |
