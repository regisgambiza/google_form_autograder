## Key Concepts  
- **Triangle Angle Sum:** In any triangle, the three interior angles add up to 180°.  
- **Isosceles Property:** If two sides are equal, the angles opposite those sides are equal.  
- **Calculation:** With two base angles of 58°, the top angle is  
  \[
  180^\circ - 2(58^\circ) = 180^\circ - 116^\circ = 64^\circ .
  \]  

## Common Challenges  
- **Mis‑adding angles** (e.g., thinking the base angles sum to 180°).  
- **Confusing the top and base angles**—the “top” is the vertex angle, not one of the equal base angles.  
- **Rounding or transcribing errors**—a typo can turn 64° into 60° or “Acute” without a numerical value.  
- **Over‑thinking the geometry**—sometimes learners add extra steps or use unnecessary formulas.

## Tips to Improve  
1. **Check the diagram:** Label each angle clearly before computing.  
2. **Use the simple formula**: `Top = 180° – 2 × Base`.  
3. **Double‑check arithmetic**: 2 × 58 = 116; 180 – 116 = 64.  
4. **Practice with different base angles**: e.g., if the base angles were 70°, the top would be 40°.  
5. **Avoid unnecessary jargon**: Stick to “top angle” or “vertex angle” when describing it.

## Keep Going!  
You’ve grasped the essential idea: equal base angles and the 180° total. Each time you solve a triangle problem, write down the sum, identify equal parts, and compute. Keep practicing with variations—isosceles, scalene, right triangles—to reinforce these quick‑step methods. Great job so far; keep that confidence up, and the geometry will stay clear!
