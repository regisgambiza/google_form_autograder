## Question 1: A school orders 245.68 kg of rice. Each sack holds 10 kg. The supplier rounds the total to the nearest 10 kg. How many sacks are delivered?
**Correct Answer:** Not provided  
**Explanation / Steps:**

1. **Round the total weight.**  
   - 245.68 kg rounded to the nearest 10 kg = 250 kg.

2. **Divide by the sack weight.**  
   - 250 kg ÷ 10 kg per sack = 25 sacks.

So the school receives **25 sacks** of rice.

## Feedback
Great job! You used the correct rounding and division steps, so your answer of 25 is right.

## Steps to Solve
1. Look at the weight (245.68 kg).  
2. Round it to the nearest 10 kg → 250 kg.  
3. Divide the rounded weight by 10 kg per sack.  
4. Write the number of sacks.

## Common Mistakes
- Forgetting to round the weight before dividing.  
- Rounding the wrong way (down instead of up).  
- Doing the division first, then rounding the result.  
- Misreading the sack weight (e.g., thinking it’s 5 kg).

## Keep Practicing
Keep checking the wording carefully—especially when it says “round to the nearest 10 kg.” If you’re unsure about rounding, practice with a few numbers first. You’re doing great!
## Question 2: A shopkeeper sold 37.85 kg of mangoes on Monday and 42.45 kg on Tuesday. Round the combined weight to 1 decimal place.  
**Correct Answer:** 80.3  
**Explanation / Steps:**  
1. Add the two weights: 37.85 kg + 42.45 kg = 80.30 kg.  
2. The number is already at two decimal places.  
3. Round to one decimal place: the second decimal digit is 0, so keep the first decimal as 3.  
4. Result = **80.3 kg**.

## Feedback  
Good try! You added the two numbers, but the rounded result should be 80.3, not 80.2. Keep an eye on the digits when you round.

## Steps to Solve  
1. **Add** the two amounts.  
2. **Look** at the second decimal digit.  
3. **Round**:  
   - If it’s 0‑4, keep the first decimal.  
   - If it’s 5‑9, increase the first decimal by 1.  

## Common Mistakes  
- Mixing up the numbers when adding.  
- Forgetting to look at the second decimal digit before rounding.  
- Rounding the whole number instead of the decimal part.

## Keep Practicing  
Try another problem: 25.6 kg + 18.75 kg, then round to 1 decimal place. Remember to check the second decimal before you round!
## Question 3: A ticket price of 89.75 baht rounded to the nearest ten is 100.  
**Correct Answer:** Not provided  
**Explanation / Steps:**  
When rounding to the nearest ten, look at the digit in the ones place.  
- If that digit is 5 or more, increase the tens digit by 1.  
- If it is less than 5, keep the tens digit the same.  

For 89.75, the ones digit is 9 (which is ≥5), so we round the 8 in the tens place up to 9, giving **90**.  
Therefore, 89.75 rounded to the nearest ten is 90, **not 100**.

## Feedback  
Great effort on the question! It looks like you may have mixed up the rounding rule. Let's review it together so you can feel confident with this next time.

## Steps to Solve  
1. Identify the tens and ones digits of the number.  
2. Check the ones digit:  
   - **≥5** → round the tens digit up.  
   - **<5** → keep the tens digit unchanged.  
3. Write the rounded number (keeping the same place value).  

## Common Mistakes  
- Thinking that 89.75 is closer to 100 because 9.75 is “almost 10.”  
- Mixing up rounding to the nearest ten with rounding to the nearest hundred.  
- Forgetting to keep the same place value after rounding.

## Keep Practicing  
Try rounding these numbers to the nearest ten:  
- 57.2  
- 123.6  
- 45.5  

Keep practicing, and you’ll get the hang of it in no time!
## Question 4: 5.82 ÷ 0.01 = 582.  
**Correct Answer:** 582  
**Explanation / Steps:**  

## Feedback  
Hi! It looks like you wrote “Ghost” instead of a number. That’s okay—let’s fix it together. The correct answer is **582**. Great job for trying to answer the question!

## Steps to Solve  
1. Write the division as 5.82 ÷ 0.01.  
2. Move the decimal point of the divisor (0.01) two places to the right to make it 1.  
3. Move the decimal point of the dividend (5.82) two places to the right to make it 582.  
4. Now divide 582 ÷ 1 = 582.

## Common Mistakes  
- Writing a word instead of a number.  
- Forgetting to move the decimal point in both numbers.  
- Adding extra zeros or missing a zero when moving the decimal.

## Keep Practicing  
Try another problem: **9.6 ÷ 0.08 = ?**  
Remember: move the decimal point of the divisor and dividend the same number of places, then divide. You’ve got this!

## Question 5: A rice trader delivers 152.45 kg of rice to one shop and 248.75 kg to another. Find the total, then round to the nearest kg.
**Correct Answer:** None
**Explanation / Steps:**
## Feedback
Good job trying!  
Your answer 590 is not the correct total.  
Let’s see how to do it step by step.

## Steps to Solve
1. Write the numbers: 152.45 kg and 248.75 kg.  
2. Add the whole numbers first: 152 + 248 = 400.  
3. Add the decimal parts: 0.45 + 0.75 = 1.20.  
4. Combine the two sums: 400 + 1.20 = 401.20 kg.  
5. Round to the nearest kilogram.  
   - The decimal .20 is less than .5, so keep 401.  
6. The answer is **401 kg**.

## Common Mistakes
- **Adding wrong numbers**: Mixing up the whole part and the decimal part.  
  Example: 152.45 + 248.75 → 152 + 248 = 400, 0.45 + 0.75 = 1.20.  
- **Skipping rounding**: Forgetting to round to the nearest kg.  
  Example: Writing 401.20 instead of 401.  
- **Wrong rounding rule**: If the decimal is .5 or more, round up.  
  Example: 401.60 would round to 402.

## Question 6: A mobile phone costs 8,999.75 baht. Round the price to the nearest hundred, then to the nearest thousand.
**Correct Answer:** None
**Explanation / Steps:**
## Feedback  
Good job trying!  
The correct answer is **9,000 baht** for both rounding to the nearest hundred and to the nearest thousand.

## Steps to Solve  
1. Look at the number **8,999.75**.  
2. **Round to the nearest hundred**  
   * The tens digit is 9.  
   * 9 is 5 or more, so we round the hundreds digit up.  
   * 8,999 → **9,000** baht.  
3. **Round to the nearest thousand**  
   * The hundreds digit is 9.  
   * 9 is 5 or more, so we round the thousands digit up.  
   * 8,999 → **9,000** baht again.

## Common Mistakes  
- **Mixing up digits**: forgetting that the tens digit decides rounding for hundreds.  
- **Ignoring the decimal**: the .75 is only used for rounding, not added to the whole number.  
- **Using the wrong rule**: rounding down when the next digit is 5 or more.  

Example:  
- If the number were 8,950, the tens digit is 5, so round up to 9,000.  
- If the number were 8,940, the tens digit is 4, so round down to 8,900.

## Keep Practicing  
Try rounding 7,456.22 to the nearest ten and to the nearest hundred. You can do it!
