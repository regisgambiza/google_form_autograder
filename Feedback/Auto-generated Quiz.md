## Question 1: Which shapes are congruent?
**Correct Answer:** Shapes that are exactly the same size and shape (e.g., two squares that can be superimposed).

**Explanation / Steps:**
1. Look at the two shapes side by side.  
2. Check that every side length matches.  
3. Check that every angle matches.  
4. If all sides and angles are equal, the shapes are congruent.

## Feedback
Great job! You understood that congruent shapes must be the same size and shape. Keep checking both sides and angles the next time.

## Steps to Solve
- **Step 1:** Compare side lengths.  
- **Step 2:** Compare angles.  
- **Step 3:** Make sure you can draw one shape over the other without stretching.

## Common Mistakes
- Thinking two shapes are congruent just because they have the same area.  
- Ignoring that a shape can be rotated or flipped; congruence allows these moves.  
- Forgetting to check every angle, not just one or two.

## Keep Practicing
Try drawing two shapes and then trying to put one over the other on paper. If they match exactly, they’re congruent. Keep experimenting with different shapes and rotations!
## Question 2: Two triangles are congruent if…
**Correct Answer:** All corresponding sides and angles are equal (or the triangles satisfy one of the standard congruence tests such as SSS, SAS, ASA, AAS, or RHS).  
**Explanation / Steps:**  
A congruent triangle looks exactly like the other one. That means every side has the same length and every angle has the same size.

## Feedback
Great try! You noticed that area is the same, but congruent triangles need more than just equal area. Keep looking at the sides and angles.

## Steps to Solve
1. **Look at the sides** – Check if each side of one triangle matches the length of the corresponding side in the other triangle.  
2. **Look at the angles** – Check if each angle matches the corresponding angle.  
3. **Use a congruence rule** – If you have 3 sides (SSS), 2 sides and the included angle (SAS), etc., you can declare the triangles congruent.

## Common Mistakes
- Thinking that equal area alone means the triangles are congruent.  
- Forgetting that both sides **and** angles must match.  
- Mixing up which sides or angles correspond to each other.

## Keep Practicing
Try drawing two triangles on paper and label the sides and angles. Then test each side and angle pair. Practice with SSS, SAS, and ASA examples to feel confident. Happy learning!

## Question 3: Define congruent shapes.
**Correct Answer:** Same everything
**Explanation / Steps:**
## Feedback  
Good job!  
You wrote: **“Same everything.”**  
That is exactly the right answer. Congruent shapes are shapes that are the same in size and shape.

## Steps to Solve  
1. Think of two shapes.  
2. Check if you can put one over the other so they match perfectly.  
3. If they match, they are congruent.  
4. If they do not match, they are not congruent.

## Common Mistakes  
- **Thinking only the outline matters** – you must also match all sides and angles.  
- **Forgetting to check all angles** – even if the outline looks right, an angle that is different means the shapes are not congruent.

## Keep Practicing  
Try drawing two triangles. Move one until it lines up exactly with the other. If it lines up, they are congruent. Keep doing this, and you will master congruent shapes!

## Question 4: Give an example of congruent figures.
**Correct Answer:** None
**Explanation / Steps:**
## Feedback  
Good job trying!  
The example you gave is **not** congruent. Congruent figures look the same and are the same size.

## Steps to Solve  
1. Think of a shape, e.g., a square.  
2. Make another shape that is exactly the same size and shape.  
3. Label them both the same, e.g., “Square A” and “Square B.”  
4. Because they are the same, they are congruent.

Example:  
- Square A with sides 4 cm.  
- Square B with sides 4 cm.  

Both squares are congruent.

## Common Mistakes  
- **Wrong size**: If one square is 3 cm and the other is 5 cm, they are not congruent.  
- **Different shapes**: A square and a triangle cannot be congruent because they are different shapes.

## Keep Practicing  
Try drawing two triangles of the same size. Label them and check if they match. Keep practicing and you’ll get it!
