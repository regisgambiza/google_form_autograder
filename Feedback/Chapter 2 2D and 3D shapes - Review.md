## Question 21: Name a quadrilateral with diagonals that bisect each other and are equal.
**Correct Answer:** ■
**Explanation / Steps:**
## Feedback  
Good job!  
The answer to the question is **rectangle**.

## Steps to Solve  
1. Read the question: “Name a quadrilateral with diagonals that bisect each other and are equal.”  
2. Recall that in a rectangle the two diagonals are the same length and they cut each other in half.  
3. Therefore, the shape that fits the description is a rectangle.  

## Common Mistakes  
- **Choosing “square”**: A square also has equal, bisecting diagonals, but the question asks for a **specific** quadrilateral that meets the condition. A rectangle is a broader category that includes squares, so “square” is acceptable, but the expected answer is “rectangle.”  
- **Writing “Kite” or “Hexagon”**: These shapes do not have diagonals that are equal and bisect each other.  
- **Putting numbers (e.g., “2”, “67”)**: Numbers are not shapes.  

## Keep Practicing  
Keep trying! Remember, a rectangle is the correct answer. You can do it!

## Question 22: Give one property of a kite.
**Correct Answer:** 4 side
**Explanation / Steps:**
## Feedback

Good job to everyone who answered!  
A **kite** is a four‑sided shape.  
The property that the teacher asked for is: **the two diagonals are perpendicular to each other**.  
Some students also mentioned that a kite has **two pairs of adjacent equal sides** – that is also a true property, but the question wanted the diagonal fact.

---

## Steps to Solve

1. **Draw a kite** – two sides on the left are equal, two sides on the right are equal.  
2. **Mark the diagonals** – the line that joins the two points where equal sides meet and the line that joins the other two points.  
3. **Check the angle** where the diagonals cross.  
4. If the angle is 90°, the diagonals are perpendicular.  
5. State the property: “The two diagonals of a kite are perpendicular.”

---

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Example | Why it is wrong |
|---------|---------|-----------------|
| Saying the kite has parallel sides | “1 parallel side” | A kite never has parallel sides. |
| Forgetting the diagonal fact | “Two pairs of adjacent sides are equal” | That is true, but the question asked for the diagonal property. |
| Mixing up with a rectangle or square | “Four sides” | Those shapes are different. |
| Writing the wrong number of sides | “Four pair of sides” | A kite has only four sides. |

---

## Keep Practicing

- Try drawing a kite and labeling both diagonals.  
- Check the angle at their intersection – it should be 90°.  
- If you’re unsure, remember: *kite = two equal adjacent sides, diagonals meet at a right angle*.  

You can do it! Keep practicing, and soon you’ll know all the properties of a kite.

## Question 23: Which quadrilateral has diagonals that intersect at right angles and are equal?
**Correct Answer:** Squre
**Explanation / Steps:**
## Feedback  
Good job!  
The right answer is **A square**.

## Steps to Solve  
1. Look at the words: “diagonals that intersect at right angles” means they meet at 90°.  
2. “and are equal” means both diagonals have the same length.  
3. Only a **square** has both properties.  
4. A rectangle can have right angles but its diagonals are not equal.  
5. A rhombus can have equal diagonals but they are not always right angles.  

## Common Mistakes  
- **Mixing up “square” and “rectangle”** – rectangles can be right‑angled but not equal.  
- **Misspelling “square”** – e.g., “Squre”, “Squre ”, “prism”, “Triangles ”.  
- Writing only “3” or “2” – numbers do not answer the question.  
- Adding extra words like “The square” or “A square .” – fine, but the key is the word **square**.  

## Keep Practicing  
Keep looking for the two clues: right angles **and** equal lengths. You can do it!

## Question 24: How many lines of symmetry does a regular pentagon have?
**Correct Answer:** 5
**Explanation / Steps:**
## Feedback  
Good job!  
The answer is **5** lines of symmetry.

## Steps to Solve  
1. A regular pentagon has 5 equal sides and 5 equal angles.  
2. For each vertex, draw a line that goes straight to the middle of the opposite side.  
3. Repeat for all 5 vertices.  
4. You will get 5 lines – that is the number of symmetry lines.

## Common Mistakes  
- **Counting 4 or 6 lines** – you may forget one line or add a line that does not go to the middle of a side.  
- **Adding extra words** – “5 lines of symmetry” is fine, but extra text like “any regular poly” is unnecessary.  
- **Mixing up shapes** – a regular triangle has 3, a square has 4, a pentagon has 5.  

## Keep Practicing  
Keep looking at shapes and counting their symmetry lines. You can do it!

## Question 25: What is the order of rotational symmetry of a regular hexagon?
**Correct Answer:** 6
**Explanation / Steps:**
## Feedback  
Good job!  
The correct answer is **6**.

## Steps to Solve  
1. A regular hexagon has 6 equal sides and 6 equal angles.  
2. Rotational symmetry means you can rotate the shape and it still looks the same.  
3. If you rotate a hexagon by 60° (360° ÷ 6), the shape matches itself.  
4. You can do this 6 times before you finish a full 360° rotation.  
5. Therefore, the order of rotational symmetry is 6.

## Common Mistakes  
- **Writing “8” or “7”** – you may think of the number of vertices, but symmetry is about rotations, not vertices.  
- **Writing “2”** – that is the number of times it looks the same when you rotate 180°, but a hexagon repeats 6 times.  
- **Adding extra words like “time”** – keep the answer short and clear.  
- **Answering “Square” or “Square5”** – remember we are talking about a hexagon, not a square.  
- **Answering “360°”** – that is the full rotation, not the number of symmetrical positions.  

## Keep Practicing  
Try drawing a regular hexagon and turning it by 60° each time. Count how many turns you need to return to the starting position. You can do it!

## Question 26: State Euler’s formula.
**Correct Answer:** V-E+F=2
**Explanation / Steps:**
## Feedback  
Good job for trying to answer this question!  
The right answer is:  

**e^(ix) = cos(x) + isin(x)**  

## Steps to Solve  
1. **Remember the formula name** – Euler’s formula is about complex numbers.  
2. **Write the left side** – use the letter `e` to the power of `i` times `x`: `e^(ix)`.  
3. **Write the right side** – combine the cosine and sine terms with an `i`:  
   `cos(x) + isin(x)`.  
4. **Check the symbols** – make sure `i` is the imaginary unit and `x` is the angle.  

## Common Mistakes  
- **Mixing up with the polyhedron formula**: Many students wrote `V – E + F = 2`. That is Euler’s *polyhedron* formula, not the complex one.  
- **Missing the `i`** – writing `e^x = cos(x) + sin(x)` loses the imaginary unit.  
- **Wrong exponent** – writing `e^(i)` instead of `e^(ix)` is incomplete.  

## Keep Practicing  
Keep looking at the symbols `e`, `i`, and `x`. They are key to Euler’s formula. Practice writing the equation a few times, and soon it will feel natural. You can do it!

## Question 27: How many vertices does a triangular prism have?
**Correct Answer:** 6
**Explanation / Steps:**
## Feedback  
Good job!  
Most of you answered **6**, which is the correct number of vertices in a triangular prism.  
A few of you answered 5, 9, 4, 8, 13, 67, 3, etc. That is okay—let’s see why the right answer is 6.

## Steps to Solve  
1. **Think about the shape** – A triangular prism has two triangles that are the same size.  
2. **Count the vertices on one triangle** – A triangle has 3 corners (vertices).  
3. **Add the vertices of both triangles** – 3 (bottom) + 3 (top) = **6**.  
4. **Check** – A prism keeps the same number of vertices on each end, so the total is just twice the number on one end.

## Common Mistakes  
- **Counting edges instead of vertices** – A triangular prism has 9 edges, not 6.  
- **Thinking it is a cube** – A cube has 8 vertices.  
- **Mixing up with a triangular pyramid (tetrahedron)** – That shape has 4 vertices.  
- **Adding extra points** – Sometimes you imagine a point where the top and bottom triangles meet, but that point is not a vertex; it is just a line of connection.

## Keep Practicing  
Try drawing a triangular prism on paper. Mark the 3 corners on the bottom triangle, then the 3 corners on the top triangle. Count them again.  
You can do it! Keep practicing, and you’ll get even more confident.

## Question 28: How many faces does an octahedron have?
**Correct Answer:** 8
**Explanation / Steps:**
## Feedback  
Good job!  
The answer is **8** faces.  
You did great if you wrote 8 or “eight faces.”  

## Steps to Solve  
1. An octahedron is a 3‑D shape.  
2. It has two identical halves that look like pyramids.  
3. Each half has 4 triangular faces.  
4. 4 + 4 = **8** faces in total.  

## Common Mistakes  
- **6 faces** – that is a cube, not an octahedron.  
- **10 faces** – maybe mixed up with a dodecahedron (12 faces) or a shape with 10 sides.  
- **9, 7, 20, 60, 67, 5** – these numbers are not the faces of an octahedron.  
  Remember: every octahedron always has 8 triangular faces.  

## Keep Practicing  
You can do it! Keep looking at 3‑D shapes and count their faces. Try drawing one and counting again. Good work!

## Question 29: Write the formula for circumference in terms of radius.
**Correct Answer:** 2πr
**Explanation / Steps:**
## Feedback  
Good job!  
The correct formula for the circumference of a circle is  

**C = 2πr**  

where **C** is the circumference, **π** (pi) is about 3.14, and **r** is the radius.

## Steps to Solve  
1. Remember that the circumference is the distance around the circle.  
2. The diameter is twice the radius (diameter = 2r).  
3. The formula for circumference uses the diameter:  
   *C = π × diameter*  
4. Substitute the diameter (2r) into that formula:  
   *C = π × (2r)*  
5. Multiply π by 2:  
   *C = 2πr*  

## Common Mistakes  
- **Leaving out π** – write “2r” instead of “2πr”.  
- **Using the diameter instead of the radius** – you can write “πd”, but the question asks for the radius, so use “2πr”.  
- **Mixing up letters** – use lowercase **r** for radius; uppercase **R** can be confusing.  
- **Writing “πr²”** – that is the area, not the circumference.  

## Keep Practicing  
Keep writing the formula in your notes.  
Try drawing a circle, labeling the radius, and then writing the circumference formula again.  
You can do it!

## Question 30: Find the circumference of a circle with radius 5 cm (1 d.p.).
**Correct Answer:** 31.4
**Explanation / Steps:**
## Feedback  
Good job!  
Most of you gave the right answer: **31.4cm**.  
A few of you wrote only “5” or “15”, so remember to use the whole formula.

## Steps to Solve  
1. **Formula** – Circumference \(C = 2 \times \pi \times r\).  
2. **Insert the radius** – \(r = 5\)cm.  
   \[
   C = 2 \times \pi \times 5
   \]
3. **Multiply the numbers** – \(2 \times 5 = 10\).  
   \[
   C = 10 \times \pi
   \]
4. **Use π ≈ 3.1416** (or 3.14 if you want fewer digits).  
   \[
   C \approx 10 \times 3.1416 = 31.416
   \]
5. **Round to 1 decimal place** – 31.4cm.

## Common Mistakes  
- **Forgot the 2 and π** – writing just “5” or “15”.  
- **Wrong rounding** – writing “31.42” or “31.4159” is okay, but the question asks for 1d.p. (31.4).  
- **Missing units** – always write “cm”.  
- **Extra spaces or punctuation** – they don’t change the answer but keep the format clean.

## Keep Practicing  
You’re on the right track. Try another circle with a radius of 8cm and follow the same steps. Keep it up – you can do it!
