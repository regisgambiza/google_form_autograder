## Question 12: A clock shows 3 o’clock. What is the angle between the hands?
**Correct Answer:** 90
**Explanation / Steps:**
## Feedback  
Good job to everyone who wrote **90**!  
You answered the question correctly.  
If you wrote something else (like 45, 30, 0, or “East”), that is okay.  
We can learn from those answers too.

## Steps to Solve  
1. Look at the clock at **3 o’clock**.  
2. The minute hand is on **12**.  
3. The hour hand is on **3**.  
4. Each number on a clock is **30 degrees** apart  
   (360° ÷ 12 = 30°).  
5. From 12 to 3 is **3 numbers** × 30° = **90°**.  
6. The angle between the hands is **90°**.

## Common Mistakes  
- **Writing 45° or 30°**  
  *Mistake*: thinking the hour hand moves 15° per hour.  
  *Correct*: the hour hand moves 30° per hour, so 3 numbers = 90°.

- **Writing 0°**  
  *Mistake*: thinking the hands are on the same spot.  
  *Correct*: at 3 o’clock the minute hand is on 12, not on 3.

- **Using words like “East” or “Acute angle”**  
  *Mistake*: confusing direction with measurement.  
  *Correct*: the question asks for a number in degrees.

- **Putting the wrong symbol (e.g., “90 c” or “090°”)**  
  *Mistake*: typing errors.  
  *Correct*: any way to write 90°, such as 90, 90°, 90º, is fine.

## Keep Practicing  
Try another clock problem:  
**What is the angle when the clock shows 6:00?**  
Remember the steps above. Keep up the good work!

## Question 13: A temple roof is shaped like an isosceles triangle. Two base angles are 58°. Find the top angle.
**Correct Answer:** 64
**Explanation / Steps:**
## Feedback  
Good job!  
All the students wrote the correct answer: **64°**.  
That means you understood the idea of an isosceles triangle.  

## Steps to Solve  
1. In any triangle, the sum of the three angles is **180°**.  
2. The two base angles are each **58°**.  
3. Add the base angles: 58° + 58° = **116°**.  
4. Subtract the sum of the base angles from 180°:  
   180° – 116° = **64°**.  
5. The top angle is **64°**.  

## Common Mistakes  
- **Adding wrong**: 58° + 58° = 120° (wrong).  
- **Subtracting wrong**: 180° – 120° = 60° (this is why some wrote 60°).  
- **Missing the degree symbol**: 64 vs 64°.  
- **Thinking the triangle is a right triangle**: No, all angles are not 90°.  

### Example of a mistake  
If you add the base angles incorrectly:  
58° + 58° = 120°  
Then 180° – 120° = 60° → wrong answer.  

Always double‑check the addition of the base angles before subtracting from 180°.  

## Keep Practicing  
You can do it! Try another isosceles triangle where the base angles are 70°.  
Use the same steps and you will find the top angle in no time. Keep up the great work!

## Question 14: A road sign shows a turn of 135°. What type of angle is this?
**Correct Answer:** Obtuse
**Explanation / Steps:**
## Feedback  
Good job! You gave the right answer many times. The correct answer is **Obtuse**.

## Steps to Solve  
1. Look at the number 135°.  
2. Think of the two key limits:  
   * 90° = right angle  
   * 180° = straight angle  
3. 135° is bigger than 90° but less than 180°.  
4. Any angle between 90° and 180° is called an **obtuse angle**.  

So the road sign shows an obtuse angle.

## Common Mistakes  
- **Calling it just “Angle”** – every angle is an angle, but we need the type.  
- **Using direction words like “SW” or “South west”** – those describe direction, not angle type.  
- **Thinking it is a reflex angle** – reflex angles are >180°.  
- **Writing “135” only** – the number alone does not show the type.  

Example:  
*Wrong:* “135” → we don’t know what it is.  
*Right:* “Obtuse” → we know it is between 90° and 180°.

## Keep Practicing  
You are learning well! Keep checking whether an angle is <90°, 90°, or >90° to decide if it’s acute, right, or obtuse. You can do it!

## Question 15: A student measures two angles of a triangle: 72° and 38°. Find the missing angle.
**Correct Answer:** 70
**Explanation / Steps:**
## Feedback  
Good job! You answered the missing angle correctly many times. The answer is **70°**.  

## Steps to Solve  
1. Remember: in any triangle the angles add up to 180°.  
2. Add the two known angles: 72° + 38° = 110°.  
3. Subtract that sum from 180°: 180° – 110° = 70°.  
4. The missing angle is 70°.  

## Common Mistakes  
- **Wrong sum**: If you add the angles incorrectly (e.g., 72° + 38° = 100°), you will get the wrong result.  
- **Wrong subtraction**: Subtracting 110° from 180° gives 70°, but if you accidentally do 110° – 180°, you get a negative number.  
- **Different answer**: Some of the wrong answers (60°, 50°, “West”) show the calculation was not done or the concept of a triangle was not used.  

## Keep Practicing  
You’re on the right track! Keep checking that the three angles sum to 180°. Keep practicing, and you will get even better!

## Question 16: A ship leaves Pattaya with a bearing of 090°. Which direction is it sailing?
**Correct Answer:** 90°
**Explanation / Steps:**
## Feedback  
Good job! You are learning how to read a bearing.  

The correct answer is **East**.  

## Steps to Solve  
1. Look at the bearing number.  
2. 090° means 90 degrees from north, turning clockwise.  
3. 90° is exactly to the right of north.  
4. That direction is East.  

## Common Mistakes  
- **Thinking 090° is West** – West is 270°.  
- **Using 90° as “North”** – North is 000° or 360°.  
- **Adding extra words like “Southeast”** – 090° is straight East, not a diagonal.  

## Keep Practicing  
Keep checking the number and remember the order: North → East → South → West. You can do it!

## Question 17: A flagpole leans making an angle of 95° with the ground. Classify the angle.
**Correct Answer:** Obtuse
**Explanation / Steps:**
## Feedback  
Good job!  
The correct answer is **Obtuse**.

## Steps to Solve  
1. Look at the number of degrees.  
2. 90° is a right angle.  
3. If the angle is more than 90° but less than 180°, it is obtuse.  
4. 95° is larger than 90°, so it is obtuse.

## Common Mistakes  
- Saying the angle is **acute** (less than 90°).  
- Thinking 95° is a **right** angle.  
- Calling it **reflex** (more than 180°).  
- Forgetting that angles are compared to 90°.

## Keep Practicing  
Try other angles: 30°, 120°, 200°.  
You can do it!

## Question 18: A triangle has angles 50° and 80°. Find the third angle.
**Correct Answer:** 50
**Explanation / Steps:**
## Feedback

| Student Response | Result |
|-------------------|--------|
| **50, 50°, 50 degrees** | ✔️ Correct! |
| **50⁰, 50c** | ✔️ Correct (just a different way to write 50). |
| **70, 65°, 180°, 110, 130, 30** | ❌ Incorrect. |

**Great work** to everyone who got the right answer!  
If you answered a number other than 50, let’s see why.

## Steps to Solve

1. **Know the rule:** In any triangle, the sum of the three angles is 180°.
2. **Add the known angles:**  
   50° + 80° = 130°.
3. **Subtract from 180°:**  
   180° – 130° = **50°**.

That is the third angle.

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Example | Why it is wrong |
|---------|---------|-----------------|
| Forgetting that the sum is 180° | “70” | 50 + 80 + 70 = 200°, too big. |
| Adding instead of subtracting | “180” | 50 + 80 + 180 = 310°, not a triangle. |
| Using the wrong angles | “110” | 110 is the difference between 180 and 70, not the missing angle. |
| Mixing units (degrees vs. radians) | “50c” | “c” is not a unit; just ignore it. |

Common error: **adding the third angle instead of subtracting**.  
Remember: `third angle = 180 – (first + second)`.

## Keep Practicing

You can do it!  
Try another triangle: if two angles are 60° and 70°, what is the third? Use the same steps. Keep practicing and you’ll master it!

## Question 19: A park entrance forms a right angle. What is its measure?
**Correct Answer:** 90
**Explanation / Steps:**
## Feedback  
Good job on trying the question!  
The correct answer is **90 degrees**.

## Steps to Solve  
1. Look at the word “right angle.”  
2. A right angle is a special angle that is exactly 90°.  
3. So the measure is **90°** or just **90**.

## Common Mistakes  
- **Adding letters or words** after the number (e.g., “90 c” or “South”).  
- **Using the wrong symbol** like “90^0” or “90º” – these are fine, but keep the format simple.  
- **Writing a different number** such as 30, 45, or 50.  
- **Leaving the degree symbol out** – some teachers prefer “90°”.

## Keep Practicing  
Keep looking for the word “right” and remember it is always 90. You can do it!

## Question 20: A ship sails from Phuket with a bearing of 180°. Which direction is this?
**Correct Answer:** South
**Explanation / Steps:**
## Feedback  
Good job to everyone who answered **South**!  
If you didn’t, don’t worry—let’s see how to find the direction.

## Steps to Solve  
1. Start at **North**.  
2. A bearing is a direction measured clockwise from North.  
3. Count degrees: 90° is **East**.  
4. 180° is the next 90°, so it points to **South**.  
5. 270° would be **West**.  

So a bearing of 180° means the ship is going **South**.

## Common Mistakes  
- **Answering “North”**: That is 0° or 360°, not 180°.  
- **Answering “90”**: 90° is East, not South.  
- **Saying “Reflex angle”**: A reflex angle is >180°, but bearings stay 0–360°.  
- **Answering “Northeast” or “East”**: These are 45° or 90°, not 180°.  
- **Writing “180°” as the direction**: The number is the bearing, not the direction.

## Keep Practicing  
You can do it! Keep checking the compass and practicing bearings. The more you practice, the easier it will become. Good luck!

## Question 21: The hands of a clock show 12:30. What is the angle between them?
**Correct Answer:** 165
**Explanation / Steps:**
## Feedback  
Good job! You all are trying hard.  
The correct answer is **165°**.

## Steps to Solve  
1. The minute hand is at 30 minutes, so it points at the 6 → 180° from 12.  
2. The hour hand moves ½° each minute. In 30 minutes it moves 30 × ½° = **15°** from the 12.  
3. The hour hand is at 15°.  
4. The angle between them = 180° – 15° = **165°**.

## Common Mistakes  
- **Thinking the minute hand is at 12** → gives 0° or 180°.  
- **Mixing up degrees with straight angle** (180°) → some wrote “straight angle” but the real angle is 165°.  
- **Using only the hour hand’s position** → some wrote 115° or 80°.  

### Example  
Wrong: “The hour hand is at 1 (30°) and the minute hand at 6 (180°). 180° – 30° = 150°.”  
Correct: “Hour hand is at 15°, minute hand at 180°. 180° – 15° = 165°.”

## Keep Practicing  
Keep checking each hand’s position first. You can do it! 🌟

## Question 22: A bridge forms an isosceles triangle with two equal angles of 75°. Find the third angle.
**Correct Answer:** 30
**Explanation / Steps:**
## Feedback  
Good job!  
You answered correctly. The third angle is **30°**.

## Steps to Solve  
1. In any triangle, the three angles add up to **180°**.  
2. The bridge has two equal angles of **75°** each.  
3. Add the two equal angles: 75° + 75° = **150°**.  
4. Subtract this from 180° to find the third angle:  
   180° – 150° = **30°**.

## Common Mistakes  
- **Adding the wrong number of angles**: remember a triangle always has 3 angles.  
- **Using the wrong total (e.g., 360°)**: triangles sum to 180°, not 360°.  
- **Wrong subtraction**: 180° – 75° = 105°, not the third angle.  
- Example of a mistake:  
  - Someone might say 180° – (75° × 2) = 180° – 150° = 30°.  
  - If they forgot to multiply by 2, they would get 180° – 75° = 105°, which is wrong.

## Keep Practicing  
Try another triangle problem:  
- Two angles are 60° and 80°. What is the third angle?  
Keep practicing, and you will get even faster!

## Question 23: A student turns through 270°. What type of angle is this?
**Correct Answer:** Reflex
**Explanation / Steps:**
## Feedback  
Good job to everyone who answered **Reflex angle**!  
That is the correct answer.  
If you answered something else, don’t worry—let’s see how to find the right answer and what to watch out for.

## Steps to Solve  
1. Look at the size of the angle: **270°**.  
2. Remember the categories:  
   * Acute: <90°  
   * Right: 90°  
   * Obtuse: >90° and <180°  
   * Straight: 180°  
   * Reflex: >180° and <360°  
3. 270° is bigger than 180° and smaller than 360°.  
4. Therefore, it is a **reflex angle**.

## Common Mistakes  
| Wrong answer | Why it is wrong | Example |
|--------------|-----------------|---------|
| **Acute** | 270° is much bigger than 90°. | “Acute” means <90°. |
| **Obtuse** | 270° is >180°, not just >90°. | “Obtuse” means 90°–180°. |
| **Half circle** | Half circle is exactly 180°. | 270° is a quarter more. |
| **West / Southwest** | These words are directions, not angle types. | “West” means 270° on a compass, but the question asks for the type. |
| **Reflect / Feglex / Reflex angel** | Small spelling errors. | The correct word is **Reflex**. |

## Keep Practicing  
Keep checking the size of the angle first.  
If it is between 180° and 360°, it is always a reflex angle.  
You can do it! Keep up the good work.

## Question 24: A boat travels on a bearing of 045°. Which direction is this?
**Correct Answer:** NE
**Explanation / Steps:**
## Feedback  
Good job to everyone who tried!  
The correct direction for a bearing of **045°** is **NorthEast**.  

Most of you wrote “Northeast” or “NorthEast” – that is right.  
A few wrote “Northwest” or just “East.” Those are not the same as 045°.  

## Steps to Solve  
1. **Start at North.**  
2. **Move clockwise** (to the right) 45°.  
3. You end up halfway between North and East.  
4. That direction is called **NorthEast**.

## Common Mistakes  
- **Thinking 045° means 45° from East.**  
  *Wrong*: 045° is measured from North, not from East.  
- **Writing “Northwest”.**  
  *Wrong*: Northwest is 315°, not 45°.  
- **Using only “East” or “North”.**  
  *Wrong*: 045° is not straight East (90°) or straight North (0°).  

## Keep Practicing  
Try more bearings: 090°, 180°, 270°, and see what directions they give. You can do it! Keep up the good work.

## Question 26: A market sign makes an angle of 25°. What type of angle is it?
**Correct Answer:** Acut
**Explanation / Steps:**
## Feedback  
Good job!  
The correct answer is **Acute**.

## Steps to Solve  
1. Look at the number of degrees: **25°**.  
2. Remember the rule:  
   * Less than 90° = Acute  
   * Equal to 90° = Right  
   * More than 90° = Obtuse  
3. Since 25° is less than 90°, the angle is **Acute**.

## Common Mistakes  
- Writing “Cute” instead of “Acute.”  
- Thinking 25° is a right or obtuse angle.  
- Forgetting to compare the number with 90°.  
- Adding extra words like “angle” when the answer is just “Acute.”  

## Keep Practicing  
Try another angle: 70°. What type of angle is it? Keep practicing and you will get better!
