## Question 21: Define categorical data.
**Correct Answer:** Labels
**Explanation / Steps:**
## Feedback  
Good job to everyone who tried!  
The correct definition of **categorical data** is:  

> **Data that can be grouped into categories or labels, not measured by numbers.**

You saw many good answers that say “data in group” or “data in categories.”  
Those are right.  
Some answers were only examples (eye colour, fruits, phone brands) or numbers (1, 2, 5).  
Those are not the definition itself.

## Steps to Solve  
1. Look at the word *categorical*.  
2. Think of “category” = a group or label.  
3. Remember that categorical data is **not a number**.  
4. Put it together: “Data that can be sorted into categories.”

## Common Mistakes  
- Writing only examples instead of the definition.  
  *Example:* “Eye colour” – this is an example, not the definition.  
- Using numbers or letters as the answer.  
  *Example:* “1” or “2” – not a definition.  
- Saying it is numeric data.  
  *Example:* “Data that is measured with numbers” – wrong.

## Keep Practicing  
You are doing well!  
Keep thinking of “groups” and “labels” when you see the word *categorical*.  
Try to write the full sentence again:  
“Categorical data is data that can be grouped into categories.”  

You can do it!

## Question 22: Give an example of discrete data.
**Correct Answer:** 1
**Explanation / Steps:**
## Feedback  
Good job!  
You gave many good answers.  
The best answer is **“Number of siblings.”**  
That is a clear example of discrete data because you can only count whole numbers: 0, 1, 2, 3, …  

## Steps to Solve  
1. **Think about counting** – Discrete data is data that is counted.  
2. **Look for whole numbers** – The answer should be a whole number, not a fraction or a measurement.  
3. **Give a real‑life example** – Choose something that people can count, like siblings, pets, books, or cars in a parking lot.  

## Common Mistakes  
- **Using words that sound like “countable” but are not** – e.g., “Temperature” is continuous, not discrete.  
- **Adding extra words or punctuation** – “Number of siblings ” (with a space) is still correct, but keep it tidy: “Number of siblings.”  
- **Mixing up continuous data** – “Number of cars in a parking lot” is fine, but if you say “The number of cars in the lot” and then add extra details, it can be confusing.  

## Keep Practicing  
You can do it!  
Try writing three more examples of discrete data. Keep the sentences short and clear. Good luck!

## Question 23: Give an example of continuous data.
**Correct Answer:** Height
**Explanation / Steps:**
## Feedback  
Good job! Many of you gave the right answer.  
Only a few of you wrote something that wasn’t an example of continuous data.

## Steps to Solve  
1. **Know what continuous data is** – it can be measured and can have any value in a range.  
2. **Think of something that can be measured** – with a ruler, thermometer, clock, etc.  
3. **Give one clear example** – for example, “the height of a person.”

## Common Mistakes  
- **Too short** – writing just “Height” or “Temperature” without context.  
- **Wrong numbers** – answering “2”, “3”, or “.” which are not examples of data.  
- **Mixing many items** – writing “Weight temperature time” together.  
- **Wrong word** – typing “Hieght” or “Dhzhz”.

## Keep Practicing  
Try to write a full sentence next time, e.g. “The height of a student is a continuous data example.”  
You can do it!

## Question 24: Name one method of collecting data.
**Correct Answer:** Survey
**Explanation / Steps:**
## Feedback  
Good job!  
The correct answer is **Observation**.  

## Steps to Solve  
1. Think about how we get information.  
2. Look at the word “observe” – it means watching something.  
3. That is a way to collect data: we see and record what happens.  

## Common Mistakes  
- **Answering “Survey” or “Interview”** – These are also ways to collect data, but the question asked for *one* method.  
- **Writing “Observation ” with a space or punctuation** – It is still correct, but keep the spelling neat.  
- **Answering a number (e.g., “3” or “2”)** – Numbers are not methods of collecting data.  

## Keep Practicing  
Keep reading the questions carefully. Try to write the exact word that fits. You can do it!

## Question 25: What is the population in a survey?
**Correct Answer:** A group
**Explanation / Steps:**
## Feedback  
Good job!  
The correct answer is: **Whole group**.  

You did a good job saying “Whole group” and many of you explained it in different words. That shows you understand the idea.

---

## Steps to Solve  
1. Think of a survey.  
2. The **population** is everyone that could be asked, not just the people who answer.  
3. So, write “Whole group” or “All people we want to study”.  

---

## Common Mistakes  
- **Answering “Sample”** – the sample is only a part of the population.  
- **Saying “Everyone in a place”** – that is fine, but make sure it is the group you want to learn about, not just anyone who happens to be there.  
- **Using words like “volunteers”** – volunteers are a *subset* of the population, not the whole group.  

---

## Keep Practicing  
Keep thinking about who you want to learn about before you answer. You can do it! Keep up the good work.

## Question 26: What is a sample?
**Correct Answer:** Part of population
**Explanation / Steps:**
## Feedback  
Good job to everyone who answered!  
- Many of you gave the right idea that a sample is a **smaller part of a larger group** (the population).  
- Some answers added extra detail, like “represent the whole” or “used for study.”  
- A few responses were a bit unclear or had spelling mistakes.  

### Correct Answer  
A sample is a **smaller, manageable subset of a larger group, called a population.**

## Steps to Solve  
1. **Know the terms**  
   * *Population* = the whole group you want to learn about.  
   * *Sample* = a few members taken from that group.  
2. **Remember the purpose**  
   * A sample is chosen so we can learn about the whole population without checking everyone.  
3. **Write it simply**  
   * “A sample is a small part of a larger group (population) that we study.”  

## Common Mistakes  
| Mistake | Why it’s wrong | Better way |
|---------|----------------|------------|
| Saying “A sample is the number of subjects” | It’s not the number, it’s the group itself. | “A sample is a group of people/items.” |
| Saying “A sample is a part of a population” only | Misses that it is **smaller** and **used to represent** the whole. | “A sample is a smaller part of a population used to learn about the whole.” |
| Using wrong spelling like “populaton” or “groip” | It looks unclear. | Check spelling or ask for help. |
| Adding unrelated words like “Google” or “example” | These do not answer the question. | Focus on the definition. |

## Keep Practicing  
You all did a great job!  
- Try to write the definition in one clear sentence.  
- Remember the key words: *small*, *subset*, *population*, *represent*.  
- Keep working and you will get even better.  

You can do it!

## Question 27: How can you make a sample random?
**Correct Answer:** Spin a wheel
**Explanation / Steps:**
## Feedback  
Good job!  
You answered the question many times.  
The idea of a random sample is that **every person or item has the same chance of being chosen**.  
You mentioned hats, numbers, and computers – all good ways to do it.

## Steps to Solve  
1. **Know your population** – who or what you want to study.  
2. **Make a list** of all members of that population.  
3. **Give each member a number** (1, 2, 3, …).  
4. **Choose a random method** –  
   * Throw the numbers into a hat and pick.  
   * Use a random number generator on a phone or computer.  
   * Spin a wheel with the numbers on it.  
5. **Pick until you have enough** for your sample size.  

All members get the same chance.

## Common Mistakes  
- **Not listing everyone first** – if you skip people, the sample is not random.  
- **Choosing only a few names** – you need to keep picking until you reach your sample size.  
- **Using a biased method** – e.g., picking the first name you see is not random.  

Example:  
Wrong: “I will just choose the first two names.”  
Right: “I will write all names, number them, then use a random generator to pick the needed numbers.”

## Keep Practicing  
Keep trying different random methods.  
The more you practice, the easier it will be to remember the steps.  
You can do it!

## Question 28: Why is a very small sample unreliable?
**Correct Answer:** Its too small
**Explanation / Steps:**
## Feedback  
Good job!  
The best answer is: **“Because it is not accurate for the whole group.”**  

## Steps to Solve  
1. Think about a sample.  
2. A very small sample has only a few people.  
3. With few people, the results can be very different from the real group.  
4. Therefore the small sample does not show the true picture of the whole group.  

## Common Mistakes  
- Saying the sample is “random” is not the reason it is unreliable.  
- Saying “it has low power” is a technical way of saying it is not accurate.  
- Forgetting that a small group can easily give a wrong picture.

## Keep Practicing  
Keep thinking about how many people are needed to see the true pattern. You can do it!

## Question 29: What does “biased question” mean?
**Correct Answer:** Is unfair
**Explanation / Steps:**
## Feedback  
Good job!  
You answered the question many times. The best answer is:  

**“A biased question is a question that pushes people to give one particular answer.”**

## Steps to Solve  
1. Read the question: “What does ‘biased question’ mean?”  
2. Think about what “bias” means – it is a tendency to favour something.  
3. A question that has bias is one that is not neutral.  
4. So the meaning is that the question makes people think they must answer in a certain way.  

## Common Mistakes  
- **Wrong word “unfair”** – while unfair and biased are similar, the main idea is that the question favours one answer, not that it is unfair to a person.  
- **Thinking it is about numbers** – “biased” does not refer to a number or amount.  
- **Missing the word “push” or “lead”** – these words show that the question tries to guide the answer.  

Examples of bad answers:  
- “Leads answer” (missing a verb)  
- “Unfair question” (wrong word)  
- “Question that is not random” (talks about sampling, not the question itself)

## Keep Practicing  
Keep reading and listening to questions. Look for words like *push, lead, favour*. You can do it!

## Question 30: What is sample size?
**Correct Answer:** How many volunteers
**Explanation / Steps:**
## Feedback  
Good job!  
You answered the question many times, and most of them are right.  
The answer is: **the number of subjects in the sample.**  
That means how many people, animals, items, or observations you actually used in your study.

## Steps to Solve  
1. Think about the word *sample*.  
2. A sample is a small part of a bigger group (the population).  
3. *Sample size* is simply the count of that small part.  
4. So write the number of people or items you chose.

Example:  
- If you studied 30 students, the sample size = 30.  
- If you looked at 50 cars, the sample size = 50.

## Common Mistakes  
- **Mixing up sample size with population size.**  
  *Population* is the whole group.  
  *Sample size* is only the part you studied.  
- **Using words like “amount” or “how big” without giving a number.**  
  You need a clear number, not just a description.  
- **Answering “1” or “.”** – Those are not valid unless you actually studied one person.

## Keep Practicing  
Try writing the sample size for a few simple examples:  
1. 15 books on a shelf.  
2. 22 friends in a class.  
3. 8 apples in a basket.  

You can do it! Keep writing the numbers, and you will become even more confident.
