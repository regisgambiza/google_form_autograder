## Question 21: Write the prime factorization of 72.
**Correct Answer:** 3²,2³
**Explanation / Steps:**
## Feedback  
Good job!  
You did a great job of writing the prime factors of 72 in many of your answers.  
The correct prime factorization is:

**2 × 2 × 2 × 3 × 3**  

(You can also write it as \(2^3 \times 3^2\).)

## Steps to Solve  
1. **Start with 72.**  
2. **Divide by 2** (the smallest prime number).  
   - 72 ÷ 2 = 36  
3. **Divide 36 by 2.**  
   - 36 ÷ 2 = 18  
4. **Divide 18 by 2.**  
   - 18 ÷ 2 = 9  
5. **Now 9 is not divisible by 2**. Try the next prime, 3.  
   - 9 ÷ 3 = 3  
6. **Divide 3 by 3.**  
   - 3 ÷ 3 = 1  
7. **All numbers are 1** – you have found all the prime factors.  
8. **Write them out**: 2, 2, 2, 3, 3.  

## Common Mistakes  
- **Writing “22233”** – this looks like one number, not separate factors.  
- **Missing a factor** – e.g., writing only “3” or “8”.  
- **Wrong exponents** – writing \(2^3 \times 3^3\) adds an extra 3 that is not in 72.  
- **Random symbols** – using “?” or “.” instead of the factors.  

### Example of a correct answer  
- \(2^3 \times 3^2\)  
  *Here “^3” means “times itself 3 times” and “^2” means “times itself 2 times”.*

## Keep Practicing  
You are doing well! Keep trying to break numbers down into primes. Remember to check each step carefully. You can do it!

## Question 22: What is the GCF of 16 and 24?
**Correct Answer:** 8
**Explanation / Steps:**
## Feedback  
Good job!  
Most of you answered **8**, which is the right answer.  
A few of you wrote other numbers (like 36 or 20) or gave a wrong set of factors.  

## Steps to Solve  
1. **List the factors of 16**  
   - 1, 2, 4, 8, 16  
2. **List the factors of 24**  
   - 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24  
3. **Find the common factors**  
   - 1, 2, 4, 8  
4. **The largest common factor is** → **8**  

(You can also use prime factorisation:  
16 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 2  
24 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 3  
The common part is 2 × 2 × 2 = 8.)

## Common Mistakes  
- **Mixing up the numbers** – writing 36 or 20 instead of 8.  
- **Leaving out a factor** – e.g., only listing 1, 2, 4 and missing 8.  
- **Wrong prime factorisation** – using 3 in the product for 16 (16 has only 2’s).  

## Keep Practicing  
You are on the right track!  
Keep checking both lists of factors and look for the biggest one that appears in both.  
You can do it!

## Question 23: Write the LCM of 9 and 12.
**Correct Answer:** 36
**Explanation / Steps:**
## Feedback  
Good job!  
The correct answer is **36**.  
Many of you wrote 36 – that’s great! Some wrote other numbers, and that is okay – we can see why it happened.

## Steps to Solve  

**Method 1: Multiples**  
1. Write the multiples of 9: 9, 18, 27, 36, …  
2. Write the multiples of 12: 12, 24, 36, …  
3. The first number that appears in both lists is **36**.  
That is the Least Common Multiple (LCM).

**Method 2: Prime factors**  
1. 9 = 3 × 3 = 3²  
2. 12 = 2 × 2 × 3 = 2² × 3  
3. Take the highest power of each prime: 2² and 3².  
4. Multiply them: 2² × 3² = 4 × 9 = **36**.

## Common Mistakes  

| Wrong answer | Why it happened | Fix |
|--------------|-----------------|-----|
| 3, 9, 15, 18 | Forgot to find *common* multiples or mixed up numbers | Look for a number that is a multiple of **both** 9 and 12 |
| 2/3, 10 | Mixed up division or prime powers | Write the numbers fully, then multiply |
| 108 | Multiplied too many factors | Only multiply the needed powers: 2² × 3² |
| “2 × 2 × 3 × 3” written without a result | Forgot to multiply the factors | 2 × 2 × 3 × 3 = 36 |

## Keep Practicing  

- Try the LCM of 6 and 8.  
- Use both methods above and see if you get the same result.  
- You did great today – keep it up! You can do it!

## Question 24: Simplify the fraction 20/30.
**Correct Answer:** 2/3
**Explanation / Steps:**
## Feedback
Good job!  
Most of you answered the right fraction, 2/3.  
A few of you wrote numbers that are not the same as the simplified fraction.

## Steps to Solve
1. Write the fraction: 20 ÷ 30.  
2. Find a number that divides both 20 and 30.  
   * 10 divides 20 (20 ÷ 10 = 2).  
   * 10 also divides 30 (30 ÷ 10 = 3).  
3. Replace 20 with 2 and 30 with 3.  
4. The simplified fraction is **2/3**.

## Common Mistakes
- **Writing a whole number** (e.g., 10, 75, 178).  
  Remember a fraction stays a fraction unless it becomes 1/1.  
- **Using a wrong divisor** (e.g., dividing by 5 gives 4/6, still not simplest).  
- **Missing the division step** and writing the same fraction (20/30) as the answer.  

Example:  
Wrong: 20 ÷ 5 = 4, 30 ÷ 5 = 6 → 4/6 (still can be simplified).  
Correct: 20 ÷ 10 = 2, 30 ÷ 10 = 3 → 2/3.

## Keep Practicing
Keep trying the same steps. You are doing well, and soon every answer will be 2/3! Happy math!

## Question 25: Write the prime factors of 45.
**Correct Answer:** 5,3
**Explanation / Steps:**
## Feedback  
Good job!  
You can write the prime factors of **45** in many ways:  
- 3 × 3 × 5  
- 3,3,5  
- 3² × 5  
All of those are correct.  

Some of you wrote numbers that are not prime factors (e.g., **41** or **5** only).  
If you write the answer with any symbols that look confusing (like “32x5” without the caret), it might be read wrong.  

## Steps to Solve  
1. Start with the number 45.  
2. Check if it is divisible by the smallest prime, **2**.  
   - 45 ÷ 2 is not an integer, so not divisible by 2.  
3. Check the next prime, **3**.  
   - 45 ÷ 3 = 15 → 3 is a factor.  
4. Divide 15 by 3 again.  
   - 15 ÷ 3 = 5 → another 3 is a factor.  
5. The remaining number is **5**, which is a prime.  
6. Write the prime factors: 3 × 3 × 5.  
   - You can also write 3² × 5.  

## Common Mistakes  
| Mistake | Why it is wrong | Correct example |
|---------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Writing only one factor, e.g., “5” | 45 is not a single prime. | “3 × 3 × 5” |
| Using a composite number like 9 | 9 is not prime. | “3 × 3 × 5” |
| Typing 41 | 41 is a prime, but it is not a factor of 45. | “3 × 3 × 5” |
| Mixing symbols, e.g., “3 2 x 5” | Looks like “32” (32) which is wrong. | “3² × 5” |
| Writing “335” | No separation of factors. | “3 × 3 × 5” |

## Keep Practicing  
You’re all doing great!  
Try factoring other numbers like 56 or 72.  
Remember: keep dividing by the smallest prime until you reach 1.  
Keep up the good work!

## Question 26: Express 0.6 as a fraction in simplest form.
**Correct Answer:** 3/5
**Explanation / Steps:**
## Feedback  
Good job!  
You did a great job with most of the answers.  

## Steps to Solve  
1. Write the decimal 0.6 as a fraction with a denominator of 10:  
   0.6 = 6 ÷ 10 = **6/10**  
2. Reduce the fraction by dividing both numerator and denominator by the same number.  
   6 ÷ 2 = 3,10 ÷ 2 = 5.  
   So 6/10 = **3/5**.  

## Common Mistakes  
- **Leaving 6/10**: Many students wrote 6/10 but did not simplify it.  
- **Wrong fraction**: Some wrote 2/3 or 0.3/0.3.  
  *Example*: 0.3/0.3 = 1, not 0.6.  

## Keep Practicing  
Keep trying! The more you practice, the easier it will become. You can do it!

## Question 27: What is the smallest prime number?
**Correct Answer:** 2
**Explanation / Steps:**
## Feedback  
Good job to everyone who answered **2**!  
You are right – the smallest prime number is 2.  

Some of you wrote **1** or other numbers. 1 is not a prime number.  
Remember, a prime number is a number that has only two divisors: 1 and itself.  

## Steps to Solve  
1. Think of the first few whole numbers: 1, 2, 3, 4…  
2. Check if each number can be divided by a number other than 1 and itself.  
3. 1 can only be divided by 1. It has only one divisor, so it is **not** prime.  
4. 2 can be divided by 1 and 2. It has exactly two divisors.  
5. Therefore, 2 is the first (smallest) prime number.

## Common Mistakes  
- **Answering 1** – 1 has only one divisor, so it is not prime.  
- **Answering a big number** – you may think “prime” means big, but the question asks for the *smallest*.  
- **Writing “2??” or “Gcf of 16and24”** – these are not answers to the question.  

## Keep Practicing  
You did great! Try to remember the definition of a prime number: only 2 divisors. Keep checking small numbers and you will always find the answer. You can do it!

**Explanation / Steps:**
## Feedback  

Good job to everyone who wrote the prime factorization of **84**!  
The correct answer is:  

**2 × 2 × 3 × 7**  

Many of you already wrote it correctly, sometimes with a different style (using `×`, `*`, or superscripts).  

### Which answers are right  

| Student response | Is it correct? | Why |
|------------------|----------------|-----|
| `2 x 2 x 3 x 7` | ✔ | Same as the correct answer. |
| `2×2×3×7` | ✔ | Same, just different symbol. |
| `2 × 2 × 3 × 7` | ✔ | Same. |
| `2^2x3x7` | ✔ | Uses exponent, still correct. |
| `2² × 3 × 7` | ✔ | Same, just different formatting. |

| `7×2²×3` | ✔ | Order does not matter. |
| `2x2x3x7` | ✔ | Same. |
| `2 * 2 * 3 * 7` | ✔ | Same. |
| `2 × 2 × 3 × 7  ` | ✔ | Extra spaces are fine. |

### Which answers are almost right  

| Student response | Why it’s almost right | What to fix |
|------------------|-----------------------|-------------|
| `2x6x7` | 6 is not a prime number | Write 6 as `2 × 3` |
| `2x2x2x7` | Three 2’s instead of two | Remove one 2 |
| `3` | Only one factor, missing the rest | Write all factors |
| `2 2 3 7` | Missing the multiplication sign | Add `×` or `*` |
| `2x2x3x7,` | Extra comma at the end | Remove punctuation |
| `1,2,4,6` | Those are divisors, not prime factors | Use primes only |
| `127` | Completely wrong | Re‑check the steps |
| `16` | Wrong number | 84 is not 16 |
| `0.875` | Wrong number | 84 is not 0.875 |

| `2 2 3. 7` | Wrong punctuation | Use `×` or `*` |
| `7x3x2x2` | Order is fine, but you wrote `x` instead of `×` | Any symbol works |
| `2x3x7x2` | Order is fine, but you used `x` | Any symbol works |
| `4 x 3*3` | Wrong because 3 is repeated, 4 is not prime | Use 2×2×3×7 |
| `2×2×3×7  ` | Extra spaces | Spaces are okay, just ignore |

### Which answers are wrong  

| Student response | Why it’s wrong |
|------------------|----------------|
| `2237` | Numbers are stuck together, no multiplication |
| `3` | Only one factor, missing the rest |
| `127` | Wrong number |
| `84 = 2 × 2 × 3 × 7 = 2^2 × 3 × 7` | This is actually correct, but if you marked it wrong it’s because you didn’t read it fully |
| `1` | 84 is not 1 |
| `.` | Not a factorization |
| `2 × 2 × 3 × 7 ` (extra spaces) | Fine, just ignore spaces |
| `16` | Wrong number |
| `0.875` | Wrong number |
| `7×2²×3` | Correct, but some might think order matters – it doesn’t |

## Steps to Solve  

1. **Start with the number 84.**  
2. **Divide by the smallest prime (2).**  
   - 84 ÷ 2 = 42 → write `2`.  
3. **Divide the result by 2 again.**  
   - 42 ÷ 2 = 21 → write another `2`.  
4. **Now 21 is not divisible by 2. Try the next prime, 3.**  
   - 21 ÷ 3 = 7 → write `3`.  
5. **The remainder is 7, which is prime.**  
   - Write `7`.  
6. **Prime factorization is the list of all primes we used:**  
   - `2 × 2 × 3 × 7`.

## Common Mistakes  

- **Using a composite number (like 6) instead of its prime factors.**  
  *Fix:* Always break composite numbers into primes.  
- **Missing one factor.**  
  *Fix:* Count how many times you divided.  
- **Writing numbers together (`2237`).**  
  *Fix:* Use multiplication signs or spaces.  
- **Including non‑prime numbers (like 4, 6, 16).**  
  *Fix:* Only use primes (2, 3, 5, 7, 11, …).  
- **Misplacing symbols (`x` vs `×` vs `*`).**  
  *Fix:* Any symbol is fine, but keep it consistent.  
- **Changing the order?**  
  *Note:* Order does not matter, but keep the same set of primes.

## Question 29: Convert 7/8 into a decimal.
**Correct Answer:** 0.875
**Explanation / Steps:**
## Feedback  
Good job! Most of you gave the right answer: **0.875**.  

## Steps to Solve  
1. Write the fraction as a division: **7 ÷ 8**.  
2. 8 goes into 7 zero times, so write **0.**.  
3. Bring down a 0 → 70 ÷ 8 = 8 remainder 6 → first decimal **8**.  
4. Bring down another 0 → 60 ÷ 8 = 7 remainder 4 → second decimal **7**.  
5. Bring down one more 0 → 40 ÷ 8 = 5 remainder 0 → third decimal **5**.  
6. The number is **0.875**.

## Common Mistakes  
- **0.9** – you rounded too early.  
- **0.785** – the division was wrong.  
- **87.5** – that is 7/8 × 100, not the decimal form.  
- **0.6** – wrong result.  
- Some wrote “Idk” or random numbers; double‑check your work before answering.

## Keep Practicing  
Try dividing another fraction, like 5/6, by writing it as a division and following the same steps. You can do it!

## Question 30: Find the LCM of 5 and 7.
**Correct Answer:** 35
**Explanation / Steps:**
## Feedback  

Good job, everyone!  
You did a great job on the question. The correct answer is **35**.  

## Steps to Solve  

1. Look at the two numbers: **5** and **7**.  
2. Notice that both numbers are prime (they have no divisors other than 1 and themselves).  
3. For prime numbers, the least common multiple (LCM) is simply their product.  
4. Multiply them: \(5 \times 7 = 35\).  
5. Therefore, the LCM is **35**.

## Common Mistakes  

| Mistake | Why it happens | Example |
|---------|----------------|---------|
| Saying the larger number (7) is the LCM | Thinking “LCM” means the bigger number | “LCM = 7” |
| Adding the numbers instead of multiplying | Confusing LCM with sum | “5 + 7 = 12” |
| Writing a random answer like “1947” or “6” | Guessing or not reading the question | “Answer = 1947” |
| Putting a sentence or a symbol (“Jesus is king”, “.”) | Not giving a numerical answer | “Answer = Jesus is king” |

If you see any of these, double‑check the steps above.

## Keep Practicing  

You are all on the right track. Keep practicing finding LCMs, especially for numbers that are not prime. You can do it!
